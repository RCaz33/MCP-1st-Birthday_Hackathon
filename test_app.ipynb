Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n5. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'numpy\\', \\'pandas\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n9. Don\\'t give up!

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef clinical_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Retrieve and parse clinical study data for a given disease. Use ClinicalTrialsSearchTool for trials, search_pubmed for authors, and parse_pdf for full-text analysis. Return structured tables or summaries as requested.Gather general or recent information from online sources. Use Wikipedia for overviews, DuckDuckGo for recent data, and VisitWebpageTool for specific URLs. Return structured summaries with sources.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef search_online_info(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Gather general or recent information from online sources. Use Wikipedia for overviews, DuckDuckGo for recent data, and VisitWebpageTool for specific URLs. Return structured summaries with sources.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n5. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'numpy\\', \\'pandas\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n9. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nfind me 10 clinical studies about diabetes made in fance, make sure to include the pmid'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n# Facts Survey\\n\\n## 1.1.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works similarly to calling a tool: provide the task description as the \\'task\\' argument. Since this team member is a real human, be as detailed and verbose as necessary in your task description.\\nYou can also include any relevant variables or context using the \\'additional_args\\' argument.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n```python\\ndef clinical_agent(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Retrieve and parse clinical study data for a given disease. Use ClinicalTrialsSearchTool for trials, search_pubmed for authors, and parse_pdf for full-text analysis. Return structured tables or summaries as requested.Gather general or recent information from online sources. Use Wikipedia for overviews, DuckDuckGo for recent data, and VisitWebpageTool for specific URLs. Return structured summaries with sources.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\ndef search_online_info(task: str, additional_args: dict[str, Any]) -> str:\\n    \"\"\"Gather general or recent information from online sources.

Return structured summaries with sources.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        task: Long detailed description of the task.\\n        additional_args: Dictionary of extra inputs to pass to the managed agent, e.g. images, dataframes, or any other contextual data it may need.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n5. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'collections\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'numpy\\', \\'pandas\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'re\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\']\\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n9. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'New task:\\nfind me 10 clinical studies about diabetes made in fance, make sure to include the pmid'}], tool_calls=None, raw=None, token_usage=None), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>, content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Here are the facts I know and the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task:\\n```\\n# Facts Survey\\n\\n## 1.1.
