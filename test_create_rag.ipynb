       "'The Joint Gromov Wasserstein Objective for Multiple Object\\nMatching\\nAryan Tajmir Riahi1, and Khanh Dao Duc 1,2,∗\\n1 Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada\\n2 Department of Mathematics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada\\nAbstract\\nThe Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric\\nspaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects,\\nlimiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object\\nmatching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the\\noriginal framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formu-\\nlation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of\\nmm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and\\nsolved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport,\\nincluding entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching in-\\ndicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments\\non both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including\\ngeometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex\\nmatching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.\\nIntroduction\\nFinding correspondence between two objects is a central problem in computer science with applications such\\nas shape interpolation and texture transfer in computer vision [1], account linking across social networks [2],\\nor protein structure analysis [3, 4]. Despite extensive research on object matching across these domains,\\nexisting methods mostly address full-to-full shape matching [1, 5, 6, 7], where both objects are assumed to be\\ncomplete with no significant missing parts. A smaller body of work focuses on partial-to-full matching [1, 8, 9,\\n10], where an incomplete object is matched against a complete reference. However, when multiple fragments\\nmust be assembled—a scenario arising in protein model building [4], merging partial 3D scans [11], and\\nsolving 2D and 3D puzzles [12, 13]— current approaches require sequential pairwise matching. This strategy\\ncan lead to error accumulation and increased computational cost, motivating the need for multiple-to-multiple\\npartial matching methods.\\nRecently, Optimal Transport theory (OT) [14] and its related tools became a popular choice establishing\\ncorrespondence between two objects represented as measurements over a metric space in graph matching\\n[15, 16], graph clustering [17], matching language models [18], and biomolecule matching [4, 3, 19]. In\\nparticular, approximations of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance [20] have gained popularity, as they\\nprovide a powerful tool for matching objects defined in different domains and are rigid body transformation\\ninvariant (so they don’t require pre-alignment). Furthermore, researchers have designed various extensions\\nand variants of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance [21, 22, 23] for partial-to-full matching. The Z-Gromov-\\nWasserstein distance [24] was recently introduced for the multiple-to-multiple partial matching problem,\\nassuming a Z-structure on the distributions. However, many multiple-to-multiple matching applications lack\\nsuch structure in the data.\\nIn this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) problem, that is a novel variant of the\\noriginal Gromov-Wasserstein formulation that enables the matching of two collections of objects simultane-\\nously. To summarize, our key contributions are as follows.\\n∗ corresponding author: kdd@math.ubc.ca\\n1\\narXiv:2511.16868v1  [cs.CV]  21 Nov 2025•We formulate the new JGW objective function, which extends the mathematical concepts underlying\\nthe Gromov-Wasserstein objective function, such as metric measure spaces and isomorphisms, to handle\\ncollections of objects. We prove theoretical properties of the JGW objective, analyzing its metric\\nproperties and convergence from point sampling.\\n•We investigate and adapt existing approximation techniques from the standard Gromov-Wasserstein\\nproblem to our the JGW framework, to produce feasible and applicable algorithms to compute it.\\n•We demonstrate the usefulness of the JGW formulation through benchmarks against other GW vari-\\nants, and experiments on object matching problems with various datasets including 2D/3D geometric\\nshapes and biomolecular complexes.\\nRelated Work\\nHere, we cover most recent works on partial and multiple-to-multiple object matching, with a focus on\\nOT-related approaches. We refer interested readers to [1] for a broader survey of object matching methods.\\nPartial Matching.Partial-to-full matching, where an incomplete query must be aligned to a complete\\ntemplate, has received considerable attention due to its practical importance in object recognition and re-\\ntrieval. Early approaches adapted full matching techniques by incorporating outlier handling mechanisms [1]\\nor by identifying and matching salient regions [25]. The SHREC benchmark for partial matching [9] has\\ndriven progress in this area, with top-performing methods leveraging learned descriptors [10], and region\\ngrowing strategies [25]. Graph matching has been extended to the partial setting through modifications that\\nallow node and edge deletions [26, 27], while point cloud methods have incorporated robust estimators [28]\\nand learned features [29] to handle missing data. In the optimal transport framework, partial variants such\\nas unbalanced [30, 23] and semi-relaxed [22, 21] optimal transport have been developed.\\nMultiple-to-Multiple Matching.Matching multiple objects simultaneously, rather than through se-\\nquential pairwise alignments, has been explored primarily in the context of full shape collections. Litany et\\nal. [13] used an extension of Partial Functional Maps to introduce a framework for multiple-to-multiple shape\\nmatching. Wu et al. introduced an alternative approach by simultaneous partial functional correspondence\\n[31]. In the context of Optimal Transport Theory, the Z-Gromov-Wasserstein distance [24] was recently\\nintroduced, extending the traditional Gromov-Wasserstein framework to match distributions equipped with\\nZ-structure. However, many multiple-to-multiple matching applications lack such structure in the data.\\nGromov-Wasserstein Distance\\nIn this section we briefly introduce the traditional Gromov-Wasserstein distance [20] along with key defini-\\ntions.\\nPreliminaries\\nSuppose we are given two compact metric spaces (X, d X),(Y, dY ) and measuresµ X, µY . Following [20],\\ndefine themetric measure space(mm-space) and theset of all couplings, two fundamental concepts for the\\ndefinition of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, as follows.\\nDefinition 1.A metric measure space (mm-space) is a triple(X, d X, µX), where(X, d X)is a compact\\nmetric space andµ X is a Borel probability measure, i.e.,µ X(X) = 1and supp[µ X] =X. An example of a\\ndiscrete mm-space is illustrated in Figure 1a.\\nDefinition 2.Two mm-spaces(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY )are called isomorphic if there exists isometry\\nψ:X→Y, i.e.,d x(x, x′) =d y(ψ(x), ψ(x′))for anyx, x ′ ∈X, such that(ψ#µ X) =µ Y , where#denotes\\nthe pushforward operator. Note that isomorphism is an equivalence relation, and the GW problem aims to\\ndefine a metric between equivalence classes of mm-spaces.\\n2The main goal of the GW problem is to define a metric between “nonequal” classes of mm-spaces. To\\ncomplete this task, [20] definesisomorphismas a notion of equality between mm-spaces.\\nDefinition 3.Given two mm-spaces(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY ),M(µ X, µY )denotes the set of all trans-\\nportation plans, such that,µ∈ M(µ X, µY )is a Borel probability measure onX×Y, and satisfies the\\nmarginal constraintsµ(A×Y) =µ x(A)for any Borel subsetA⊂X, andµ(X×B) =µ y(B)for any Borel\\nsubsetB⊂Y.\\nFormulation\\nThese definitions enable us to define theGromov-Wasserstein distanceas a comparison method between\\nmm-spaces.\\nDefinition 4.[20] Given two mm-spaces(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY ), the Gromov-Wasserstein distance\\nbetweenXandYis defined as\\nGWΓ,p(X, Y) =\\ninf\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX×Y\\nZ\\nX×Y\\nΓ(x, y, x′, y′)µ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhereΓ :X×Y×X×Y→Ris called the loss function. With the typical choice ofΓ p(x, y, x′, y′) =\\n|dX(x, x′)−d Y (y, y′)|p we often denoteGW Γp,p(X, Y)byGW p(X, Y).\\nThe minimizer of this optimization problem is called thetransportation plan, and it can be used to find\\na matching betweenXandY, as a metric function between isomorphy classes of mm-spaces:\\nTheorem 5([20]).GW p defines a metric on the collection of all isomorphism classes of mm-spaces.\\nThe Joint Gromov-Wasserstein Objective\\nPreliminaries and Definition\\nTo enable multiple-to-multiple object matching, we extend fundamental concepts associated with the GW\\ndistance, by first introducingdistributions of metric measure spaces(see also Definition 1).\\nDefinition 6.A distribution of mm-spaces is a categorical distribution ofk X mm-spaces, usually denoted\\nX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX], where\\n(i)∀i∈[k X],(X i, dXi, µXi)is a metric measure space (called clusteri)\\n(ii)s Xi ∈R >0 is the probability assigned to clusteri.\\nFigure 1 shows an illustrative comparison between a mm-space (1a) and a distribution of mm-spaces (1b).\\nTo provide a framework for comparing distributions of mm-spaces, we introduce the notion ofembedding:\\nDefinition 7.Given a distribution of mm-spacesX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX], an embedding ofXis a\\nmm-space(X, dX, µX)such that there existk X isometries(ψ i :X i →X) i∈[kX], such that\\n(i) P\\nj∈[kX] sXj ×ψ j#µXj =µ X\\n(ii)∀(j, k)∈[k X]2,ψ j(Xj)∩ψ j(Xk) =∅\\n(iii)X= S\\ni∈[kX] ψXi(Xi).\\nWe call theψ i’s embedding functions.\\nUsing embeddings, we now formulate the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective:\\nDefinition 8.Given two distributions of mm-spacesXandYand embeddings(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY )\\nwith embedding functions(ψ Xi)i∈[kX] and(ψ Yi)i∈[kY ] respectively, the joint Gormov-Wasserstein divergence\\nbetweenXandYis defined by\\nJ GWp(X,Y) =GW Γ∗p,p(X, Y),(2)\\n3where for all(i, j)∈[k X]×[k Y ]and(x, x ′, y, y′)∈Im(ψ Xi)2 ×Im(ψ Yj )2,\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) =|d X(x, x′)−d Y (y, y′)|p,(3)\\nandΓ ∗\\np = 0otherwise.\\nWe note that while the definition ofJ GWp(X,Y) uses given embeddingsX, Y, its value and the asso-\\nciated transport plan do not depend on these. They also neither depend on the choice of the embedding\\nfunctions:\\nTheorem 9.Given two distributions of mm-spacesXandYand different embeddingsX 1, X2 forXand\\nY1, Y2 forY, we have\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) =GW Γ∗p,p(X2, Y2).\\nWe provide a detailed proof of this theorem in Appendix A.\\nPartial Ismorphism\\nTo establish key properties of the Joint Gromov Wassertein objective function as a similarity measure between\\ndistributions of mm-spaces, we now extend the notion of isomorphism (Definition 2) topartial isomorphism\\nas follows.\\nDefinition 10.Two distributions of mm-spacesX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX] andY= (Y i, dYi, µYi, sYi)i∈[kY ]\\nare called partially isomorphic if there exists a distribution of mm-spacesZ, indexed by(i, j)∈[k X ×k Y ]\\nZ= (Z i,j, dZi,j , µZi,j , sZi,j )i∈[kX],j∈[kY ],\\nand isometry functionsψ X\\ni,j :Z i,j →X i andψ Y\\ni,j :Z i,j →Y j, such that\\nX\\nj\\nψX\\ni,j#µZi,j ×s Zi,j =µ Xi ×s Xi and\\nX\\ni\\nψY\\ni,j#µZi,j ×s Zi,j =µ Yj ×s Yj .\\nSimilar to [20] for mm-spaces, we can then extend Theorem 5 to distributions of mm-spaces:\\nTheorem 11.Given two distribution of mm-spacesX,Yandp∈[1,∞),J GW p(X,Y) = 0if and only if\\nXandYare partially isomorphic.\\nFor a detailed proof, see Appendix B.\\nRemark 11.1.Although Theorem 11 shows that some properties of isomorphism ofGW p naturally extend to\\nJ GWp, note that the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective function does not form a proper distance function\\nthat holds the triangle inequality (which is not issue for our goal of matching two collections of objects).\\nAs a counterexample, letX={0,1},Z={0,2}, both equipped with the uniform distribution andYbe a\\ndistribution of mm-spaces with two one-point set clusters of equal mass. One can verify thatXandYare\\npartially isomorphic, thus,J GWp(X,Y) = 0. With the same argument we can see thatJ GW p(Z,Y) = 0.\\nHowever,XandZare not partially isomorphic henceJ GW p(Z,X)>0.\\nPoint Sampling Convergence\\nIn the context of shape matching, having point sampling convergence for the objective is crucial, since objects\\nget discretized or represented by point clouds. The following theorem ensures that we also asymptotically\\nrecover JGW when doing so:\\nTheorem 12.LetX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX] be a distribution of mm-spaces andp∈[1,∞),n∈N.\\nConsiderni.i.d samples fromX(by randomly picking a clusterjfrom Cat(s i) and sampling a point inX j\\nfromµ Xj ), distributed into thek X mm-spaces ofXas{X n\\ni }i∈[kX]. LetX n be a distribution of mm-spaces\\ndefined as(X n\\ni , dXi, µi, sXi)i∈[kX] whereµ i is the uniform measure onX n\\ni . ThenJ GWp(Xn,X)→0almost\\nsurely asn→ ∞.\\nFor a detailed proof, see Appendix C.\\n4The Joint Gromov-Wasserstein Objective in Finite Space\\nIn practice, we are interested in solving a discretized version of the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective\\nfunction. Formally, letX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX] andY= (Y i, dYi, µYi, sYi)i=1∈[kY ], withX i andY i being\\nfinite for alli, and let us denoten Xi andn Yi the cardinal ofX i andY i respectively, soX i ={x i,j}j∈[nXi]\\nandY i ={y i.j}j=1∈nYi\\n, with pairwise distance matricesd Xi ∈R\\nnXi×nXi\\n≥0 andd Yi ∈R\\nnYi×nYi\\n≥0 . To simplify\\nour embedding notation, we also denoteX= SkX\\ni=1 Xi andY= SkY\\ni=1 Yi. We now createµ X andµ Y as\\ndistributions overXandYrespectively, as\\nµX[xi,j] =s XiµXi[xi,j], µ Y [yi,j] =s YiµYi[yi,j].\\nNote that with this definition we clearly haveµ X[X] =µ Y [Y] = 1. Next, we define the block matrices\\ndX =\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\ndX1 0. . .0\\n0d X2 . . .0\\n... ... ... ...\\n0 0. . . d XkX\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\uf8fa\\uf8fb, I X =\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\nJnX1 ,nX1\\n0. . .0\\n0J nX2 ,nX2\\n. . .0\\n... ... ... ...\\n0 0. . .

For simplicity, we now assumep= 2 and\\ndenoteJ GW2(X,Y) byJ GW(X,Y). Using (1) and (2), we have\\nJ GW(X,Y) = min\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed X\\ni,j,k,l\\n|dX\\nij −d Y\\nkl|2IX\\nij IY\\nklµikµjl\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n1/2\\n.(4)\\nRegularization and Computation\\nOur goal is now to computeJ GW(X,Y) as given in equation (4). One of the main limitations of the Gromov-\\nWasserstein distance is the non-convexity of its formulation which makes its computation challenging. To\\novercome this challenge, various approximations and algorithms for GW distance or its variants have been\\nproposed, such as linear lower bounds [20], entropic regularization [32], operator splitting-based relaxation\\n[16], and Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm [22]. To compute (4) we can adapt most of these techniques,\\nincluding methods used in [16, 32, 22], and one of the linear lower bounds proved in [20]. In the rest of this\\npaper, as a proof of concept, we focus on adapting entropic regularization [32], which is one of the most\\nwidely used approximations for OT problems [33]. To do so, we introduce the regularization term to (4):\\nJ GWϵ(X,Y) = min\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed X\\ni,j,k,l\\n|dX\\nij −d Y\\nkl|2IX\\nij IY\\nklµikµjl +ϵH(µ)\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n1/2\\n,\\nwhereHis the usual entropy function defined by\\nH(µ) =−\\nX\\ni,j\\nµi,j log(µi,j),\\nandϵ∈R ≥0 is called theregularization parameter.\\nProposition 13.GivenX,Yandϵ∈R ≥0, we have\\nJ GWϵ(X,Y) =min\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2 (⟨µ,Λ(µ)⟩+ϵH(µ)) 1/2 ,\\nwhere⟨., .⟩is the inner product of two given matrices, the superscript∧2denotes the elementwise square of\\na matrix, andΛis defined as\\nΛ(µ) =d X∧2µIY −2d XµdY +I XµdY∧2 .\\n5We prove Proposition 13 Appendix D. Using this Theorem and with the same argument as [34, 32], we\\ncan compute the transportation plan (µ) by solving\\nµ= argmin\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\nKL(µ, e\\nΛ(µ)\\nϵ ).(5)\\nTo solve (5), similar to [34, 32] we can use the following iterations\\nµ(t+1) = argmin\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\nKL(µ,\\n\\x14\\ne\\nΛ(µ(t))\\nϵ\\n\\x15∧η\\n⊗\\nh\\nµ(t)\\ni∧(1−η)\\n),(6)\\nwhere 0< η≤1 is called the convergence parameter.

None of the following\\nexperiments uses a GPU. All of the code for this paper is implemented in Python 3.10. and is available in\\nthis repository.\\nGeneral Evaluation on Partial Matching\\nTo evaluate the performance of the JGW objective, we first conducted a partial matching experiment by\\ncomparing JGW with other recent Gromov-Wasserstein variants involving two unbalanced measurements\\np, q(1 =|p|>|q|), includingthe mass-constrained Partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance(mPGW) [22],\\nthe Partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance(PGW) [21],and the Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein distance\\n(UGW) [23]. Although JGW originally operates on data from all clusters, we adapted it for this specific\\nscenario by employing dummy clusters through the constructionY={p}andX={X 1, X2}whereX 1 is\\nq/|q|with masss X1 =|q|andX 2 is a single point distribution with masss X2 = 1−|q|. Using the formulation\\nof (2), we notice that the formulation of mPGW [22] is equivalent to this special case of JGW. However, the\\ncomputation method suggested by its authors differs from the approximation we used for our computations.\\nWe generated the source distribution (q) by sampling 200 points from an Archimedean spiral with added\\nnoise, while the target distribution (p) combines 200 points sampled using the same method, but with 100\\nadditional points drawn from a standard normal distribution (see Figure 2a). We then applied mPGW[22],\\nPGW[21], UGW[23], and our proposed JGW method to compute the optimal coupling betweenpandq,\\nwith results visualized in Figure 2b. The results reveal a significant performance difference in structural\\npreservation. Both mPGW and PGW exhibit substantial difficulty in distinguishing spiral structure from\\n6added noise, incorrectly transporting nearly half (49%) of the total mass to noise points. UGW demonstrates\\nsome improvement over these methods but still suffers from significant misattribution, transporting 33% of\\nmass toward noise points, and failing to fully capture the spiral’s structural coherence. In contrast, JGW\\nachieves superior performance by effectively separating the true spiral structure from noise contamination,\\ntransporting only 0.9% of mass to noise points while preserving the geometric integrity of the spiral pattern.\\nAlthough we acknowledge that mPGW and PGW results depend critically on the initial coupling of their\\nalgorithms, our search across 50 randomly generated transportation plans, combined with the authors’\\ndefault initialization strategy, failed to yield satisfactory couplings, suggesting fundamental limitations in\\nthese methods’ ability to handle partial matching tasks.\\nSparcity of Transport Plans\\nAnother critical consideration in applications involving continuous data, such as shape-matching, is the\\nquality of the coupling matrix to find accurate one-to-one correspondences for geometric analysis. More\\nprecisely, this requires sparse transportation matrices. Note that in general, mPGW and PGW achieve\\ncompletely one-to-one matching matrices, so we here focus on both UGW and JGW, that produce diffuse\\ntransportation patterns due to their regularization terms. To examine this aspect, we analyzed the same\\nprevious experiment, and selected the leftmost point inqto visualize its corresponding transportation edges\\n(shown in purple in Figure 3a). JGW exhibits slightly more sparsity than UGW. To quantify this sparsity\\ndifference, we computed the variance of the transported mass from each source point inqfor both UGW\\nand JGW methods. The violin plot in Figure 3bdisplays the distribution of all variances, revealing JGW’s\\nbetter performance with an average variance of 29×10 −3 compared to UGW’s 38×10 −3, representing\\napproximately 24% improvement in coupling sparsity. We acknowledge that the sparsity of both methods\\ncould be enhanced by decreasing their respective regularization parameters, but such adjustments would\\ncome at the cost of increased computational complexity and runtime, creating a fundamental trade-off\\nbetween coupling sparsity and computational efficiency. Regarding computational efficiency, mPGW and\\nPGW complete their computations in 0.49 and 0.48 seconds respectively, leveraging their direct optimization\\napproach, while the regularized methods require substantially more time with UGW taking 227 seconds and\\nJGW achieving some speedup at 108 seconds with our current set of parameters, suggesting representing\\nJGW can achieve faster computation than UGW while delivering better coupling quality.\\nIn summary, our example (see Figure 2, 3) demonstrates that JGW discovers couplings that align most\\nclosely with structural expectations, outperforming all competing methods in preserving meaningful geo-\\nmetric correspondences. JGW achieves a superior sparsity/runtime trade-off compared to UGW. Although\\nmPGW and PGW offer computational advantages and perfect one-to-one couplings, these benefits come at\\nthe significant cost of the failure to preserve the underlying geometric structures.\\nApplications of JGW in Shape Matching\\nTo analyze the performance of JGW in applications related to shape matching, we designed experiments\\ninvolving 2D and 3D shape data. First, we used a typeset illustrating of three letters “A”, “B” and “C”\\n(see Figure 4asource) to build a distribution of mm-spaces with 3 clusters and use as the source space.\\nFor the target space, we used a different typeface and created one cluster with the illustration of the word\\n“ABC” (see Figure 4atarget). In Figure 4a, we color in the right panel ”result” each point in the target\\ndistribution based on the cluster from the source space, that has its corresponding coupled point in the\\nJGW transportation plan. JGW manages to transport 98.6% of the mass correctly, by using 450 points to\\nrepresent the data. This experiment took≈24 seconds to run.\\nTo test the performance of JGW on 3D data, we next used two 3D meshes from the CAPOD dataset\\n[35] of a human in different poses. We split the first mesh into 5 clusters, namely, upper body, left arm,\\nright arm, left leg, and right leg (see Figure 4b). We used the mesh vertices as our distribution points and\\napplied the same method to find correspondence and colorized matched points of each cluster in one color.\\nAs Figure 4bsuggests, JGW does a perfect job in distinguishing the arms and the body, although it confuses\\nsome parts of the legs. In total more than 80% of the mass is transported correctly, and it took 50 seconds\\nto perform this experiment. We acknowledge that due to symmetry in this particular example, it’s possible\\nto get the same result with the substitution of left and right arm/leg, depending on the initialization of our\\n7optimization process.\\nFinally, we evaluated our method on the SHREC’16 cuts dataset [9], which uses shapes from TOSCA [36]\\nand provides partial versions with different cuts (see Figure 4c). Since the SHREC’16 dataset provides only\\none partial cluster per shape, we computed the complement component as the second cluster to make it suit-\\nable for our method. Figure 4cshows the colorized correspondence diagram, demonstrating near-perfect\\nmass transportation. To quantitatively evaluate the mapping quality, we employed a standard measure com-\\nmonly used in shape matching [37, 31, 8], that is the geodesic distance between ground truth and computed\\ncorresponding points, normalized by the square root of the full shape’s area. Figure 4c(Correspondence\\nquality) presents a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of this measure across all mesh vertices. The\\nfact that the CDF reaches 100% at a geodesic error of 0.0001 suggests that this method can match complex\\nshapes with excellent accuracy. For this experiment we modeled the cat body with 10 4 points and it took\\n≈3000 seconds to run this experiment.\\nOverall, these experiments show the potential of JGW in shape matching problems.\\nAlignment of Biomolecular Complexes\\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, one of potential applications for our method is to align and fit biomolecules\\nfrom 3D density maps obtained from Cryogenic Electron Microscopy [3, 4]. To study how our framework\\ncan be applied in this context, we focus on the model-building application, where a density map (a large 3D\\nvoxelized array) and the atomic structure of its submodules are given, and the goal is to find an alignment\\nfrom the submodules to the whole map [4]. In the following experiment, we compare the performance of\\nour new joint alignment method with a previous method that uses UGW [23], named EMPOT [4] using\\nthe complex protein structure PDB:1I3Q [38]. While this atomic structure originally consists of 10 chains,\\nin order to keep the experiment simple, we here merged 5 small chains and delete 3 tiny ones, resulting in\\nan atomic model with three similar-sized chains (Figure 5aillustrates this simplified version showing each\\nchain with a unique color). To mitigate the impact of sampling point clouds from density maps, we directly\\nsampled a point cloud from each structure (each chain plus the whole structure), with 2471 points 1111, 862,\\nand 498 points from chains A, B, and C, respectively. Then we applyEMPOTand JGW to align these three\\npoint clouds to the whole map. Figure 5ashows the reconstructed model with each method, and Figure 5b\\nillustrates the result of alignment of each chain (in red) comparing to the ground truth position of it (in\\nblue). As the figure shows, JGW finds a near-perfect alignment for all chains, while EMPOT is off. For\\nquantitative measurements, we report correlation of the density maps, rotational error, and RMSD of PDB\\nmaps after applying the alignment for each chain in Table 1 that also confirms our visual assessment.\\nFinally, we also compared runtimes for the two methods. The runtime of JGW with 50 iterations is\\napproximately 805 seconds. For EMPOT, we performed two different alignments for each chain and find the\\nbest combination between these alignments, and the total runtime is around 5680 seconds. This suggests\\nthat JGW is more than 11×faster than EMPOT due to the fact that 1- we need to solve more alignment\\nproblems to align one-by-one compared to when we align them together using JGW. 2- The computation of\\nour approximation of JGW is slightly faster than the approximation UGW that is utilized for EMPOT.\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we formulate a novel variant of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance specifically designed to\\ncalculate a dissimilarity measure between two collections of mm-spaces, which we call theJoint Gromov-\\nWasserstein(JGW) objective. We prove several theoretical properties of this new variant and analyze\\nits behavior by showing useful results in the partial isomorphism and point sampling scenarios. Further-\\nmore, we propose a method to adapt existing algorithms designed for computing the entropic regularized\\nGromov-Wasserstein distance to approximate the solution of our formulation in practice. Finally, we conduct\\nextensive experiments testing our method on partial matching, shape matching, and cryo-EM density map\\nalignment tasks. Our experiments suggest that JGW is applicable to a wide range of problems, significantly\\noutperforming classical partial and unbalanced variants, including mPGW [22], PGW [21], and UGW [23]\\nwith particularly strong performance when matching multiple distributions. We also show that JGW is\\neffective for image matching and cryo-EM density map alignment, making it a suitable alignment method\\nfor cryo-EM model-building applications where multiple chains must be matched simultaneously.\\n8Among the potential directions for improving our method, we first mention that the choice of approx-\\nimation algorithm significantly affects the quality of the transportation map, which is crucial for applica-\\ntions involving continuous data types such as shape matching and cryo-EM density map alignment. Our\\nformulation of JGW can adapt most existing approximations and relaxations developed for the original\\nGromov-Wasserstein distance using a similar approach, including the methods introduced in [16, 22] and\\none of the three linear lower bounds in [20]. In the context of cryo-EM, while our results suggest that the\\npresent approach is suitable for model-building applications, further validation on additional structures with\\ndifferent approximation methods is needed. Finally, it would be valuable to test the method’s ability to\\nhandle highly heterogeneous alignments by partitioning the source map and aligning its constituent parts.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis research is supported by a NSERC Discovery Grant RGPIN-2020-05348.\\nReferences\\n[1] Sahillio˘ glu Y.

We call this map a projection.\\nProof.Defineπ X byπ X(xi) =ψ Xi(xi) for allx i ∈X i. By (ii) property of Definition 7, we know that the\\nimages ofψ Xis are distinct, thusπ X is injective. Also using (iii) property of Definition 7, we conclude that\\nπX is surjective as well.\\nProof of Theorem 9.AssumeX 1 andX 2 (respectivelyY 1 andY 2) are two distinct embeddings forX(Y) with\\nembedding functions (ψX1,i)i∈[kX], (ψX2,i)i∈[kX] ((ψY1,i)i∈[kY ], (ψY2,i)i∈[kY ]). Using Lemma 14, we define the\\nbijectionsπ X1 , πX2 , πY1 , πY2 . Now letπ ∗\\nX :X 1 →X 2 andπ ∗\\nY :Y 1 →Y 2 be defined by\\nπ∗\\nX =π X2 ◦π −1\\nX1 , π∗\\nY =π Y2 ◦π −1\\nY1 .\\nNow forx, x′ ∈X 1 andy, y′ ∈Y 1 by using the properties of projections in Lemma 14, we want to prove that\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) = Γ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′)).\\nTo do so, we distinguish the following cases:\\n•CASE 1:there existi∈[k X]andj∈[k Y ]such that(x, x ′, y, y′)∈Im(ψ X1,i)2 ×Im(ψ Y1,j )2.By (3),\\nwe can write\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) =|d X1 (x, x′)−d Y1 (y, y′)|p =|d Xi(π−1\\nX1 (x), π−1\\nX1 (x′))−d Yj (π−1\\nY1 (y), π−1\\nY1 (y′))|p\\n=|d Xi(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nX(x′))−d Yj (π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nY (y′))|p (7)\\nAlso it is straightforward to see that if (x, x′, y, y′)∈Im(ψ X1,i)2×Im(ψY1,j )2, then (π∗(x), π∗(x′), π∗(y), π∗(y′))∈\\nIm(ψX2,i)2 ×Im(ψ Y2,j )2. By combining this fact with (7) we conclude that\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) =|d Xi(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nX(x′))−d Yj (π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nY (y′))|p = Γ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′)).\\n•CASE 2:otherwise:Without loss of generality, we can assumex∈Im(ψ X1,i) andx ′ ∈Im(ψ X1,i′ )\\nwithi̸=i ′. Then\\nx∈Im(ψ X1,i)⇒π −1\\nX1 (x)∈X i ⇒π ∗(x) =π X2 ◦π −1\\nX1 (x)∈Im(ψ X2,i),\\nx′ ∈Im(ψ X1,i′ )⇒π −1\\nX1 (x′)∈X ′\\ni ⇒π ∗(x′) =π X2 ◦π −1\\nX1 (x′)∈Im(ψ X2,i′ ).\\nAs a result there exists noi∈[k X], such that (π ∗(x), π∗(x′))∈Im(ψ X2,i), therefore\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) = 0 = Γ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′)).\\nWe finalize the proof by using (1) and get\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) = inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX1×Y1\\nZ\\nX1×Y1\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′)µ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n= inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX1×Y1\\nZ\\nX1×Y1\\nΓ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′))\\nµ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n.\\n12To simplify this equation, we perform the change of variablesx∗ =π ∗\\nX(x), y∗ =π ∗\\nY (y), x′∗ =π ∗\\nX(x′) andy ′∗ =\\nπ∗\\nY (y′) and we denoteµ ∗(., .) =µ(π∗−1\\nX (.), π∗−1\\nY (.)) the image ofµunder the product mapping (π ∗\\nX, π∗\\nY ).\\nTherefore, using [39, Theorem 3.6.1], we conclude that\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) = inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX1×Y1\\nZ\\nX1×Y1\\nΓ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′))\\nµ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n= inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX2×Y2\\nZ\\nX2×Y2\\nΓ∗\\np(x∗, y∗, x′∗, y′∗)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n.\\nUsing the properties of embedding functions, it’s straightforward to check that\\nµ∗ ∈ M(µX2 , µY2 )⇐⇒µ∈ M(µ X1 , µY1 ).\\nThus, we can change the domain of infimum and complete the proof as follows.\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) = inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX2×Y2\\nZ\\nX2×Y2\\nΓ∗\\np(x∗, y∗, x′∗, y′∗)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n= inf\\nµ∗∈M(µX2 ,µY2 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX2×Y2\\nZ\\nX2×Y2\\nΓ∗\\np(x∗, y∗, x′∗, y′∗)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n=GW Γ∗p,p(X2, Y2).\\nB Proof of Theorem 11\\nLemma 15.Given two distribution of mm-spacesXandYwith embbedingsXandYrespectively, there\\nexists a couplingµ ∗ ∈ M(µX, µY )such that\\nJ GWp(X,Y) = 1\\n2 (D(µ∗))1/p ,\\nwhere\\nD(µ∗) =\\nZ\\nX×Y\\nZ\\nX×Y\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′).(8)\\nProof.For this we need to show the sequential compactness ofM(µ X, µY ) and the continuity ofD. The\\nformer is provided in [40, p. 49] and the latter follows from [20, Lemma 10.3].\\nProof of Theorem 11.LetXandYbe embeddings forXandYwith embedding functionsψ X\\ni andψ Y\\nj\\nrespectively, andDbe defined similarly as in (8).\\nFor the “if” part, we want to show that ifXandYare partially isomorphic, then there exists a coupling\\nµ∗ ∈ M(µX, µY ) such thatD(µ ∗) = 0. By definition, there exist mm-spacesZ i,j with isometry functions\\nψX\\ni,j :Z i,j →X i, ψY\\ni,j :Z i,j →Y j satisfying the conditions specified in Definition 10. For simplicity, given\\nx∈X, y∈Y, we define\\nZ(x, y) ={µZi,j (z)| ∃i∈[k X], j∈[kY ], z∈Zi,j s.t.ψ X\\ni ◦ψ X\\ni,j(z) =x, ψY\\nj ◦ψ Y\\ni,j(z) =y}.\\nNow using this operator defineµ ∗(x, y) as\\nµ∗(x, y) =\\n(P\\np∈Z(x,y) pifZ(x, y)̸=∅\\n0 else .\\n13Now consider (x1, y1) and (x 2, y2) such thatµ ∗(xi, yi)̸= 0 fori= 1,2. Sinceµ ∗(x1, y1)̸= 0,Z(x 1, y1)̸=∅\\nand there existsz 1, i1, j1 such thatψ X\\ni1 ◦ψ X\\ni1,j1 (z1) =x 1, ψY\\nj1 ◦ψ Y\\ni1,j1 (z1) =y 1. By the same argument, we\\nsimilarly definez 2, i2, j2. Ifi 1 ̸=i 2 orj 1 ̸=j 2, since the images ofψ X\\ni s are disjoint (due to the properties\\nof embedding functions in Definition 7), then Γ ∗\\np(x1, y1, x2, y2) = 0. Ifi 1 =i 2, andj 1 =j 2, we have the\\nisometriesψ X\\ni1 , ψX\\ni1,j1 , ψY\\nj1 , ψY\\ni1,j1 , and we can write\\ndZi1,j1 (z1, z2) =d Xi1 (ψX\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψX\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d X(ψX\\ni1 ◦ψ X\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψX\\ni1 ◦ψ X\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d X(x1, x2),\\ndZi1,j1 (z1, z2) =d Yj1 (ψY\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψY\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d Y (ψY\\nj1 ◦ψ Y\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψY\\nj1 ◦ψ Y\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d Y (y1, y2).\\nThis impliesd X(x1, x2) =d Y (y1, y2), so we showed that Γ ∗\\np(x1, y1, x2, y2) = 0 and as a resultµ ∗ satisfies\\nD(µ∗) = 0.\\nFor the other direction assumeJ GWp(X,Y) = 0. Using Lemma 15, there existsµ ∗ such thatD(µ ∗) = 0.\\nNow for eachi∈[k X] andj∈[k Y ] defineZ i,j as the set of couplings\\nZi,j ={(x, y)|x∈X i, y∈Yj, µ∗ \\x00\\nψX\\ni (x), ψY\\nj (y)\\n\\x01\\n̸= 0},\\nendowed with a measure where we assignµ∗ \\x00\\nψX\\ni (x), ψY\\nj (y)\\n\\x01\\nto (x, y) and normalize it. Now for (x1, y1),(x 2, y2)∈\\nZi,j, sinceD(µ ∗) = 0 andψ X\\ni , ψY\\nj are isometries, we haved Xi(x1, x2) =d Yj (y1, y2). ThusZ i,j can be\\nequipped with a metric function (eitherd Xi ord Yj ) and forms a mm-space, such that\\nZi,j →X i\\nψX\\ni,j : (x, y)7→x\\nand\\nZi,j →Y j\\nψY\\ni,j : (x, y)7→y\\nare isometries. Using the assumption thatD(µ ∗) = 0 and the isomorphism properties ofψ X\\ni andψ Y\\nj , we\\ncan further verify thatd Xi andd YJ satisfy the conditions for partial isomorphism, and thusZ i,j provides\\nthe desired partial isomorphism betweenX,Y.\\nC Proof of Theorem 12\\nProof of Theorem 12.LetXbe an embedding ofXwith embedding functionsψ i :X i →X, and{x j}j∈[n] be\\nnpoints in S\\ni∈[kX] Xn\\ni . LetX n ={ψ i(xj)|∀j∈[n], x j ∈X i}endowed with the uniform empirical measure\\non it. Asψ is hold the properties of embedding functions,X n is an embedding forX n. Therefore using (2)\\nwe have\\nJ GWp(X,X n) =GW Γ∗p,p(X, Xn).(9)\\nBy definition of Γ ∗, one can see that Γ ∗(x, y, x′, y′)≤Γ(x, y, x′, y′) for allx, y, x′, y′. Hence,\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X, Xn)≤ GWΓp,p(X, Xn).(10)\\nA similar statement forGW Γp,p ([20], Theorem 5.1e), shows thatGW Γp,p(X, Xn) almost surely converges to\\nzero asn→ ∞.

A more detailed understanding of the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin and \\nthe identification of regulators such as BCL11A provide hope that these findings will be translated \\ninto genomic-based approaches to the therapeutic reactivation of hemoglobin F production in \\npatients with SCA. Meanwhile, an unprecedented number of new drugs aimed at both the \\ntreatment and prevention of end-organ damage are now in the pipeline, outcomes from potentially \\ncurative treatments such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are improving, and \\ngreat strides are being made in gene therapy, where methods employing both antisickling β-globin \\nlentiviral vectors and gene editing are now entering clinical trials.

SCA was subsequently \\nheralded as the first “molecular disease” when Pauling et al. (149) ascribed its basis to the \\npresence of an abnormal hemoglobin, hemoglobin S (HbS), in 1949. In 1957, Ingram (100) \\ndiscovered that HbS was caused by a single amino acid substitution (glutamic acid changed \\nto valine) at position 6 of the β-globin chain of hemoglobin, and in 1963, Goldstein et al. \\n(83) showed that this amino acid substitution arose from a single base change (A>T) at \\ncodon 6 (rs334). SCA, therefore, has always been at the forefront of molecular medicine and \\narguably launched the whole field of human molecular genetics. Because of this disease’s \\ngenetic simplicity, being caused by a single change in a single gene, it has been used to \\nillustrate and validate many of the advances in this field, including proof-of-principle studies \\nin DNA diagnostics, predictive genetics, and population and epidemiological genetics (104, \\n146, 167, 171). The contribution of genetic modifiers to its extreme clinical heterogeneity \\nmade SCA an exemplar of the effects of genetic background on a single-gene disease. More \\nrecently, SCA has demonstrated the potential for genome-wide association studies in the \\ndiscovery of interacting genes that might be of clinical or therapeutic significance. Genome-\\nwide association studies of HbF, a quantitative trait that influences SCA severity, identified \\ntwo quantitative trait loci that are not linked to the HBB cluster: BCL11A and HBS1-MYB \\n(122, 195). These results have led to various genetic approaches to the reactivation of HbF \\nthat are now being explored as therapeutic options in SCA (96). Figure 1 shows a time line \\nof key genetic discoveries and significant events in SCA.\\nGiven its important role in scientific discovery, the process of translating such knowledge \\ninto new treatments has been far too slow, and for more than 30 years only two approaches \\nto disease modification—chronic blood transfusion and hydroxyurea therapy—have been \\nwidely deployed. However, more recently, a sea change in the therapeutic landscape \\nhas led to the development of numerous new drugs that target different aspects of the \\npathophysiology of SCA (189).\\nThe Molecular Basis of Sickle Cell Disease\\nThe term sickle cell disease (SCD) describes a clinical syndrome caused by the presence \\nof HbS. The genetic causes of SCD include homozygosity for the rs334 mutation (HbSS) \\n(generally known as SCA) and compound heterozygosity between rs334 and mutations \\nthat lead to either other structural variants of β-globin (such as HbC) or reduced levels \\nof β-globin production (β-thalassemia). In patients of African ancestry, SCA is the most \\ncommon cause of SCD (65–70%), followed by HbSC (about 30%), with HbS/β-thalassemia \\nbeing responsible for the majority of the balance. Although all forms of SCD are important, \\nSCA is by far the best described and is the sole focus of this review.\\nWilliams and Thein Page 2\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsThe Origins, Global Burden, and Distribution of Sickle Cell Anemia\\nThe heterozygous status of rs334 (coding for HbS) results in the sickle cell trait (HbAS), \\nin which erythrocytes contain a mixture of both normal HbA and HbS molecules. Through \\nmechanisms that have not been completely elucidated, such heterozygotes have a substantial \\nsurvival advantage in malaria-endemic environments. Large-scale genetic studies have \\nrecently revealed the extraordinary degree of this protection. In a study of almost 12,000 \\nsevere malaria cases and more than 17,000 controls conducted throughout Africa, Asia, \\nand Oceania, HbAS conferred an 86% reduction in the risk of severe malaria (odds ratio \\n0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.12–0.16) at a significance level (P = 1.6 × 10−225) rarely \\nseen in epidemiological studies (118). Furthermore, by preventing malaria, HbAS protects \\nfrom consequences of malaria such as undernutrition and fatal bacterial infections (172). \\nThese wide-ranging benefits have driven rs334 to high population frequencies throughout \\nmuch of the historically malaria-endemic world, so that carrier frequencies of 10–20% are \\nnow commonplace in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Middle East, and the \\nMediterranean basin (152) (Figure 2). Genetic analyses had suggested that rs334 arose and \\nwas amplified by selection separately in multiple populations (73), but a recent paper by \\nShriner & Rotimi (176a) has now provided evidence that it had a single origin 7,300 years \\nago in West Africa (see the Note Added in Proof at the end of this article).\\nThese high population frequencies mean that a significant proportion of babies born \\nwithin these geographic areas are affected by SCA. Furthermore, recent global population \\nmigration means that SCD is now a major contributor to health problems in many regions \\nthat are well beyond its early geographic origins (154), including the Caribbean islands, \\nBrazil, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and cosmopolitan parts of other \\nEuropean countries (154). Recent estimates suggest that globally, more than 300,000 \\nchildren are born with SCA every year (88, 153).\\nIn addition to HbS, malaria has led to positive selection for a wide range of other genetic \\nconditions in the same geographic areas. Like HbS, the best described of these conditions \\nalso relate to erythrocytes, including other structural hemoglobin variants, the thalassemias, \\nerythrocyte enzymopathies (most notably glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), \\nand polymorphisms in erythrocyte surface molecules, including the Duffy antigen receptor \\nfor chemokines (DARC), complement receptors, and ABO blood groups (216). As a result, \\nmany patients with SCA also inherit other genetic variants, some of which may affect their \\nclinical phenotype, the relevance of which we discuss in further detail below (see the section \\ntitled Factors Determining Outcome).\\nDiagnosis\\nPreconception, antenatal, and neonatal screening programs are important in the clinical \\ncare and public health management of SCA. The most common approaches to diagnosis \\nin high-income countries include gel-based or capillary electrophoresis, high-performance \\nliquid chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. All are sensitive in identifying affected \\nindividuals but are limited by their inability to reliably distinguish HbSS from HbS/β0-\\nthalassemia. However, most neonatal screening programs involve testing during the first \\nWilliams and Thein Page 3\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsweek of life, when the expression of adult hemoglobin (and, therefore, HbS) is still low, \\nwhich leads to problems with reduced sensitivity. This has prompted the development of \\nnew approaches that include tandem mass spectrometry (126), DNA diagnostics (including \\nTaqman PCR and sequence analysis of specifically amplified HBB genes) (192), and \\nnext-generation sequencing analysis (163, 176). Although these increasingly sophisticated \\nmethods are now entering clinical practice in high-income countries, few are readily \\navailable to the majority of patients in low-income regions. For many years, the mainstay \\nof diagnosis in these regions has been the sodium metabisulfite sickling test or commercial \\nvariations of it (94); however, these tests cannot reliably distinguish carriers from affected \\npatients. Several alternative, point-of-care approaches are currently under development, of \\nwhich the most advanced—an antibody-based lateral-flow assay marketed under the name of \\nSickle SCAN—is now commercially available (105).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe fundamental event that underlies the manifold pathophysiological consequences of \\nSCA is the polymerization of HbS under conditions of low oxygen tension (35). HbS \\npolymerization alters both the structure and function of erythrocytes, initiating a cascade \\nof events that ultimately affect a wide range of tissues, with far-reaching clinical and \\npathological consequences. Our understanding of these processes has been accelerated more \\nrecently through newer techniques, of which the use of murine models has been particularly \\ninfluential (225). The most important of these processes are summarized in Figure 3 and \\ndescribed in further detail below.\\nVasoocclusion\\nThe polymerization of HbS activates calcium-influx-mediated dehydration, increasing \\nthe concentration of intracellular hemoglobin, further exacerbating polymerization, and \\nultimately resulting in irreversibly distorted and bizarrely shaped erythrocytes (181). Sickled \\nerythrocytes have difficulty negotiating the microvasculature and cause logjams that result \\nin local tissue hypoxemia. The recent development of microfluidic devices provides a \\ngraphic in vitro illustration of how this simple mechanical process might lead to tissue \\nischemia in vivo (62). Nevertheless, it would be overly simplistic to attribute the tissue \\ninjury that accompanies SCA to mechanical obstruction alone. The sickled erythrocytes \\nare also highly fragile (life span of 16 days compared with 120 for normal red blood \\ncells) (90), and the continual release of cell-free hemoglobin from hemolysis depletes the \\nbioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), contributing to pathology. Neutrophilia is an additional \\nfeature of SCA that has been consistently correlated with disease severity (38, 107, 141, 156, \\n225), and more recent studies have shown that even at steady state, these neutrophils are \\nhighly activated (109, 225). The detrimental effect of neutrophils in sickle pathophysiology \\nis supported by case reports of severe and fatal acute events triggered by drug-induced \\nneutrophil production (1, 6, 86, 208). Recent studies indicate that neutrophils play a central \\nrole in vasoocclusion through their interactions with both erythrocytes and endothelium. \\nImportant elements include the activation of endothelial cells to upregulate the expression \\nof cytoadhesion molecules such as the P- and E-selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule \\n1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Endogenous factors of \\nWilliams and Thein Page 4\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptstissue activation include the release of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes (including \\nTNF-α, IL-6, IL1-β, and IL-3), while exogenous factors include microbial antigens (95). \\nObservations made in mice have shown that sickled erythrocytes bind to neutrophils \\nthat are themselves bound to inflamed cremasteric venules, resulting in vasoocclusion \\n(194). Moreover, the finding that mice deficient in P- and E-selectin are protected from \\nvasoocclusion has provided impetus for the development of treatments designed to block this \\ninteraction (194). In support of this idea, neutrophils from HbSS individuals show greater \\nlevels of obstruction compared with those from HbAA individuals in E-selectin/ICAM-1-\\ncoated microchannels (58). HbSS erythrocytes alone were nonadherent but required mixed \\nsuspensions of erythrocytes and neutrophils to elicit vasoocclusion (58). A recent study \\nshowed that neutrophils from SCA individuals can also form neutrophil extracellular traps \\nthat inflict further damage on the endothelium (45).\\nIn addition to neutrophils and monocytes, platelets are activated in steady-state patients with \\nSCA, and activation increases further during vasoocclusive crises (101, 206, 225). Platelets \\nform aggregates with erythrocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils both in patients and in \\nmurine models (57, 75, 221, 225). Moreover, as with neutrophils, it appears that this process \\nis dependent on P-selectin (159, 161). SCA has long been considered a hypercoagulable \\nstate, as illustrated by the increased rates of venous and arterial thrombotic events. Not only \\nis the incidence of venous thrombotic events increased (particularly pulmonary embolism), \\nbut these events also occur in younger patients and are significantly associated with elevated \\nsteady-state platelet counts (34, 198). This has prompted clinical trials on antiplatelet \\nagents for the prevention of acute vasoocclusive pain (below), and the hospital management \\nof acute pain crises in many centers now includes prophylactic anticoagulation. Because \\npatients who have suffered one venous thrombotic event are more likely to have additional \\nevents, it has been proposed that such patients should be placed on lifelong anticoagulation.\\nHemolysis\\nPatients with SCA are in a constant state of uncompensated hemolysis, which further \\nincreases during painful crises, as reflected by further elevated levels of plasma lactate \\ndehydrogenase (16, 77). While steady-state hemolysis involves both an intravascular and \\nan extravascular component (23), the intravascular element has been the main focus \\nfrom a pathophysiological perspective. It has been proposed that the release of both free \\nhemoglobin and arginase is directly responsible for a chain of events that results in \\nvascular pathology. Important elements include the depletion of bioavailable NO via a \\ndioxygenation reaction (165), the depletion of arginine (a substrate for NO production), and \\nthe promotion of oxidant stress and endothelial inflammation through exposure to free heme \\nand heme-laden microparticles (36). Exposure of endothelium to heme in mice leads to \\nupregulation in the production of various adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, P-selectin, \\nand fibronectin; the recruitment of neutrophils; and increased vascular permeability (207). \\nSuch observations have led to the hypothesis that excessive heme might play a role in \\nexacerbating the vasoocclusive process. Free heme also leads to the activation of neutrophils \\nand the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which damage the vasculature (45). As a \\nresult of such observations, it has been postulated that variation in the degree of hemolysis \\namong individual patients may contribute to the variable phenotypes of SCA (106).\\nWilliams and Thein Page 5\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsClinical Course and Complications\\nThe clinical course of SCA is notoriously variable. Progressive damage to a range of organs \\nis a constant feature of the disease; however, the factors that determine the degree to which \\nspecific organs are involved remain incompletely understood. Historically, the most widely \\nrecognized complications of SCA were the acute clinical events that punctuate periods \\nof reasonable health, of which pain is the most common. However, with increasing life \\nexpectancy, many complications that result from damage to a range of end organs are now \\nbeing described. The most common complications of SCA are summarized in Table 1 and \\nFigure 4 and discussed in further detail below.\\nAcute Manifestations of Sickle Cell Anemia\\nOne of the most common early manifestations of SCA is the hand–foot syndrome, which \\nis characterized by the painful swelling of one or more extremities owing to the infarction \\nof marrow within the small bones of the hands and feet (223). Beyond the first year \\nof life, the most frequent acute complication is a painful crisis. Such episodes most \\ncommonly occur in the extremities, chest, abdomen, and back and result from vasoocclusive \\nepisodes with ischemia–reperfusion injury (67). At times, painful crises can be complicated \\nby bony necrosis with secondary infections, including osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. \\nRare in the first six months of life (because fetal hemoglobin levels are still elevated), \\npainful crises become increasingly frequent thereafter, reaching an overall incidence of \\napproximately 40 per 100 person-years of observation (PYO) beyond the second year of life \\n(80). Painful crises frequently require treatment with strong analgesics, including opioids, \\nwith the attendant risk of the development of opioid dependency. Another common acute \\ncomplication of SCA is acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS presents with a clinical picture \\n(including cough, shortness of breath, and signs of consolidation and hypoxemia) that \\nis difficult to distinguish from acute pneumonia (223). Episodes can present in apparent \\nisolation or complicate painful crises or surgical procedures, particularly those involving the \\nabdomen (202, 203). Common etiological factors include acute infections, bone marrow fat \\nembolism, and microembolism of aggregated blood cells (132, 223). The incidence of ACS \\nis lower in older adults than in children (38, 203), but both severity and mortality are higher \\nin adults, largely because of a higher incidence of bone marrow and fat emboli in adults \\n(202) and the frequent presence of comorbidities.\\nAcute anemia, usually defined as a decline in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more from \\nsteady-state levels (223), is a common feature of painful crises but can also result from \\nsequestration of erythrocytes in deep vascular beds, most commonly within the spleen \\n(acute splenic sequestration) or liver (acute hepatic sequestration) (27, 89); aplastic episodes \\nsecondary to parvovirus B19 infection (174); or increased hemolysis secondary to serious \\nacute infections or delayed transfusion reactions. Patients with SCA are also at substantial \\nrisk of serious acute bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Streptococcus \\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and non-Typhi Salmonella species. Progressive \\ninvolution of the spleen leads to functional asplenia from early childhood, vasoocclusive \\nepisodes can violate the integrity of gut and other barrier tissues to result in the translocation \\nof pathogens, and ischemic tissue in various organ systems can provide a niche for septic \\nWilliams and Thein Page 6\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsfoci (31). In the preprophylaxis era, the incidence of invasive bacterial sepsis was as high as \\n10 per 100 PYO in the first 5 years of life (80).\\nThree further common acute complications are priapism, acute kidney injury, and stroke. \\nPriapism, an unwanted and painful erection of the penis that lasts for more than 2 h, is \\nfrequently recurrent and occurs with a lifetime prevalence of 20–89% in boys and men (5, \\n114, 143). Acute kidney injury is an underrecognized acute event that in one prospective \\ncase series complicated 8% of all admissions with ACS in children (110). Finally, stroke \\nis probably the most serious and devastating acute complication of SCA, occurring at an \\noverall rate of 0.61 episodes per 100 PYO before the development of specific interventions \\n(141). Strokes can be either infarctive or hemorrhagic, the former being the more common \\n(141). During childhood, the risk of infarctive stroke can be predicted from blood velocities \\nin the cerebral vessels measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography (2). As a \\nresult, TCD is now widely deployed for screening, and those with increased velocities (≥200 \\ncm/s) are deemed at high risk of developing a stroke and targeted for preventive transfusion \\ntherapy (see the section titled The Management and Outcome of Sickle Cell Anemia in \\nHigh-Income Countries).\\nChronic Complications of Sickle Cell Anemia\\nWith increasing survival, cumulative complications of SCA are becoming increasingly \\napparent in adults in high-income countries. It is now clear that subtle neurological \\ndeterioration is more common than previously realized (54). Neuroimaging studies, most \\nrecently using near-magnetic resonance imaging, have shown that silent cerebral infarcts \\n(signal abnormalities of at least 3 mm in the presence of a normal neurological examination) \\nare common, affecting 39% of patients by the age of 18 years in one such study (24). \\nRisk factors include lower hemoglobin concentrations and higher systolic blood pressures, \\nmale sex, and acute anemic events (25, 55). Chronic heart and lung complications are \\nalso common, particularly in older children and adults. Clinical manifestations include \\nimpaired pulmonary function and exercise tolerance and progressive heart failure (85). \\nPulmonary hypertension, defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of ≥25 mm Hg at \\nrest as determined by right heart catheterization, is the most common chronic pulmonary \\ncomplication of SCA and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. \\nThree studies utilizing right heart catheterization estimated the prevalence of pulmonary \\nhypertension in adults at 6.0–10.4% (74, 121, 147). In studies conducted in France and \\nBrazil, pulmonary hypertension was associated with three-year mortality rates of 12.5% \\nand 37.5%, respectively (74, 147), while a six-year mortality of 37% was reported in a \\nstudy conducted in the United States (121). Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity has been used \\nas a noninvasive alternative to right heart catheterization in the prediction of pulmonary \\nhypertension in multiple studies. Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity values of ≥2.5 m/s, as \\nmeasured by two-dimensional echocardiography, are suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, \\nand values of ≥3 m/s are strongly predictive (74, 147). Approximately half of pulmonary \\nhypertension cases are precapillary and result from a vasculopathy caused by recurrent \\nsickling, inflammation, chronic thromboembolism, and hemolysis-induced NO depletion, as \\ndiscussed above (85). The rest have postcapillary disease from left ventricular dysfunction \\nWilliams and Thein Page 7\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptscaused by elevated cardiac output and left ventricular volume overload secondary to chronic \\nanemia (131).\\nThe hypoxia, acidosis, and hyperosmolarity within the inner medulla of the renal cortex \\ncreate a perfect environment for the polymerization of HbS. Over time, repeated cycles \\nof acute kidney injury lead to the chronic microvascular disease of established sickle \\ncell nephropathy. Renal complications are manifest from early life (213) and include \\nhyperfiltration, hyposthenuria (diminished concentrating ability), and albuminuria. In \\nchildhood, sickle cell nephropathy can manifest as polyuria, nocturia, and nocturnal \\nenuresis. The prevalence of albuminuria increases with age, and in one study 60% of \\npatients with SCA had microalbuminuria by age 55 (50). Advanced chronic kidney disease \\n(stage III–IV , defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15–60 mL/min per 1.73 \\nm2) occurs in 4–18% of adults with SCA (173). Increasing renal dysfunction can also \\nresult in arterial hypertension. Table 1 summarizes additional common acute and chronic \\ncomplications of SCA.\\nFactors Determining Outcome\\nBoth environmental and genetic factors contribute to the clinical variability of SCA. \\nAlthough the importance of weather as a trigger of acute pain has been suspected for \\nmany years, it has been difficult to prove for logistic reasons (155). Twin studies suggest \\nthat environmental factors in general are important determinants of the clinical course of \\nSCA. Such studies include two case reports limited to single pairs, one with HbSS and \\nα-thalassemia and the other with HbS and β-thalassemia (8, 103), and nine pairs of identical \\ntwins from Jamaica, six with HbSS and three with HbSC (214). These studies show that, \\nwhile twins may have similar laboratory parameters and attain similar heights and weights, \\nthere is considerable discordance in the frequency of painful crises and other complications. \\nFurthermore, other environmental factors, including nutritional status and access to social \\nsupport and medical care, influence risk factors such as infections (155).\\nFactors that influence the primary event of HbS polymerization (including coexisting \\nα-thalassemia and HbF concentrations) have a global effect on the disease phenotype. \\nApproximately one-third of SCA patients of African descent also have α-thalassemia, \\nusually caused by the common African 3.7-kb (−α3.7) deletional variant (200). While the \\nmajority are heterozygous (αα/−α3.7), 3–5% are homozygous (−α3.7/−α3.7). Coexisting \\nα-thalassemia results in reduced intracellular HbS and mean corpuscular hemoglobin \\nconcentrations, reductions in the frequency of HbS polymerization and number of \\nirreversibly sickled cells, and an increased hematocrit (68, 180). While some of these \\neffects are beneficial, others are detrimental. Patients with SCA and α-thalassemia have a \\nreduced risk of hemolytic complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, \\nnephropathy, priapism, and leg ulcers, but an increased risk of vasoocclusive complications, \\nsuch as ACS, painful crises, osteonecrosis, and retinopathy (179). Several studies have \\nalso demonstrated an association with lower TCD velocities and stroke (26, 49, 71). The \\nreduced hemolysis reduces bilirubin, with a quantitative effect that is independent of that \\nof the UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism (200). However, coinheritance of α-thalassemia \\nWilliams and Thein Page 8\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsblunts the response to hydroxyurea therapy, potentially because it affects the HbF and mean \\ncorpuscular volume responses (199).\\nHbF has a sparing effect on HbS polymerization because the hybrid tetramers (α2γβS) \\nand HbF (α2γ2) have a diluting effect on the intracellular HbS (α2βS2) concentration. In \\naddition, α2γβS tetramers cannot partake in HbS polymerization. Even a small decrease in \\nHbS concentration can increase the delay time to polymerization and allow more cells to \\nescape sickling (129, 158). As a result, HbF has a globally beneficial effect on SCA: High \\nlevels are associated with reduced pain and improved survival (156), while low levels are \\nassociated with an increased risk of brain infarcts in young children (209). Genome-wide \\nassociation studies of HbF and its associated trait, erythrocytes containing HbF (or F cells), \\nhave shown that genetic variants at three quantitative trait loci—BCL11A on chromosome \\n2p, HMIP-2 on chromosome 6q, and Xmn1-HBG2 (rs7482144) on chromosome 11p—\\ntogether account for up to half of the common variation in the Caucasian non-SCA \\npopulation (191) and between 8% and ~20% of the variability in HbF concentrations among \\npatients with SCA (112, 113, 117, 219). Downstream studies in primary human erythroid \\nprogenitor cells and transgenic mice have demonstrated that BCL11A acts as a repressor \\nof γ-globin gene expression (169, 222). High-resolution mapping, further validated by \\nsystematic dissection using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing approach, has confirmed that \\nthese variants are localized to enhancers in intron 2 of the gene that are erythroid specific \\n(18).\\nWith regard to HMIP-2 on chromosome 6q, subsequent studies showed that the intergenic \\nregion contains two clusters of HbF-affecting variants that occupy critical core enhancer \\nelements that regulate MYB, which encodes the MYB transcription factor essential for \\nhematopoiesis and erythroid differentiation (177). As a result, it has been proposed that \\nMYB modulates HbF expression by two potential mechanisms: (a) indirectly, by altering the \\nkinetics of erythroid differentiation (low MYB levels accelerate erythroid differentiation \\nand lead to the release of early erythroid progenitor cells that are still synthesizing \\npredominantly HbF) (102, 178), and (b) directly, via activation of KLF1 and other repressors \\nof γ-globin genes (29, 184). Rare variants in KLF1 have also been associated with HbF \\nlevels in various erythrocyte disorders, including SCA (151). However, several genome-wide \\nassociation studies of HbF have failed to identify common KLF1 variants (28, 130). In \\nAfrican American patients and patients from Cameroon, an association between HbF and \\nthree loci (BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and XmnI-HBG2) also correlated with reductions in the \\nrates of acute vasoocclusive pain and hospitalization (113, 219), while the presence of HbF-\\npromoting variants in BCL11A was associated with a reduced rate of SCA complications, \\nparticularly with stroke in a Brazilian cohort (112).\\nCoexisting α-thalassemia and HbF concentrations alone are not sufficient to explain the \\nobserved diversity in the severity of SCA between individual patients. Both candidate gene \\nand genome-wide association studies have been used to search for other modifying genetic \\nvariants. Many of these studies have focused on specific complications of SCA (such as \\nstroke, proteinuria, osteonecrosis, or pulmonary hypertension) as separate phenotypic end \\npoints; however, given the complexity of the factors that lead to such outcomes, it is not \\nsurprising that studies that have employed more simple intermediate phenotypes that are \\nWilliams and Thein Page 9\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsreproducible, measurable, and disease related (like HbF and bilirubin levels) have been \\nmore successful. Based on an understanding of SCA pathophysiology, candidate genes \\nthat could plausibly influence different SCA-related complications have been selected \\nand single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through association studies. The \\ncomplications studied included acute painful episodes, bilirubin levels, and predisposition \\nto gallstones, stroke, priapism, osteonecrosis (or avascular necrosis), leg ulcers, pulmonary \\ndisease (pulmonary hypertension and ACS), bacteremia and other infections, and renal \\ndisease. Table 2 summarizes the genetic variants that have been associated with these major \\nSCA-related complications.\\nRates of acute pain can vary widely among patients, but the highest rates are in patients with \\nhigh hematocrits and low HbF concentrations (17). Besides HbF levels and a possible role \\nof α-thalassemia, very little is known about the genetic basis for the variability of painful \\ncrises. Case–control studies are problematic because it is difficult to objectively quantitate \\nboth the frequency and severity of painful episodes within or among patients. The response \\nto opioid analgesia varies considerably among individuals, and the efficacy of these drugs \\nmay itself be related to genetic variability in their metabolism (17). An association between \\nserum bilirubin levels or gallstones and a promoter polymorphism in UGT1A1 has been \\nconsistently demonstrated in SCA individuals of all ages and different population groups \\nusing both candidate gene and genome-wide approaches (42, 70, 124, 200). The influence of \\npolymorphisms in UGT1A1 became more evident in patients while on hydroxyurea therapy: \\nChildren with the 6/6 UGT1A1 genotype achieved normal bilirubin levels, while children \\nwith 6/7 or 7/7 UGT1A1 genotypes did not (92). Co-occurrence of α-thalassemia also has \\na quantitative effect on serum bilirubin levels in patients with SCA (200). The triad of the \\nUGT1A1 genotype, SCA, and gallstones presents a possible clinical context where genetic \\ninformation might aid clinical decision-making with regard to elective cholecystectomy.\\nA familial predisposition to stroke was first suggested by an increased incidence among \\nsiblings with SCA (61), prompting numerous genetic studies. In some, stroke was \\nsubdivided into large- and small-vessel disease based on imaging studies (97). Of the 38 \\npublished SNPs that have been associated with stroke, the effects of α-thalassemia and SNPs \\nin four genes (ADYC9, ANXA2, TEK, and TGFBR3) have been most replicable, albeit \\nat marginal levels of significance (71). Genomewide association studies and whole-exome \\nsequencing studies have recently identified additional protective associations in pediatric \\npatients at two genes (GOLGB1 and ENPP1), but, again, this warrants further validation \\n(72).\\nIndependent studies have identified associations between mutations in KLOTHO (KL) and \\npriapism in different populations (66, 139). Separately, the TGF-β/SMAD pathway has also \\nbeen implicated in priapism risk (66). Higher hematocrits are a predisposing factor for \\nosteonecrosis, and hence an increased incidence has been seen in patients with coexisting \\nα-thalassemia. Studies suggesting that factors in the coagulation pathway, such as MTHFR \\nand platelet adhesion (HPA-5B allele), may also be involved have been inconclusive (9, 15, \\n39, 108, 196).\\nWilliams and Thein Page 10\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsLeg ulceration varies widely in SCA patients, with major apparent differences in \\ngeographical prevalence. It affects up to 70% of Jamaican patients, but reported rates \\nhave been much lower (30–40%) in other patient cohorts (7). This complication is closely \\nassociated with the severity of hemolysis, which potentially explains the protective effect \\nof co-occurring α-thalassemia. Candidate gene association studies have implicated several \\ngenes in the TGF-β/SMAD/BMP pathway (138). Polymorphisms in DARC have also been \\nassociated with the persistence of leg ulcers, and it has been suggested that the relatively \\nhigher white cell and neutrophil counts potentiate inflammation in the Duffy-positive \\npatients (60).\\nPulmonary hypertension, defined by a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity of ≥2.5 m/s, occurs \\nin approximately 30% of adults with SCA and is an important risk factor for premature \\ndeath (81). Multiple gene associations have been identified, including polymorphisms \\nin the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway (ACVRL1, BMPR2, and BMP6) (10) and others \\npreviously implicated in primary idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (116). A more recent \\nmulticenter study (226) considered the hypoxic response to be contributory to pulmonary \\nhypertension. A SNP (rs10857560) associated with reduced expression of MAPK8, which \\nencodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase important for apoptosis, T cell differentiation, \\nand inflammatory responses, correlated with pulmonary hypertension.\\nA gene-centric association study of ACS using individuals from the US Cooperative Study \\nof Sickle Cell Disease found an association with rs6141803. This SNP is located 8.2 kb \\nupstream of COMMD7, a gene highly expressed in the lung that interacts with NF-κB \\nsignaling (76). Another candidate gene is heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which produces the \\nprotein HO-1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme, which might attenuate \\nthe severity of acute pain and hemolysis. Bean et al. (19) investigated a highly polymorphic \\n(GT)n dinucleotide repeat in the HMOX1 promoter and showed that children with two \\nshorter alleles had lower rates of ACS.\\nStudies have suggested that the incidence of bacterial infections among patients with SCA \\nmight be modulated by polymorphisms in MBL2 at the HLA locus, MPO (encoding \\nmyeloperoxidase), DARC, and the TGF-β/BMP pathway (4, 48, 136, 185).\\nRenal dysfunction, as measured by proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate, \\ncorrelates with the severity of hemolysis (50). Hence, it is also not surprising that co-\\noccurrence of α-thalassemia is protective against albuminuria (50, 135). The MYH9-APOL1 \\nlocus, an important genetic risk factor for end-stage renal failure in non-SCA populations \\nof African ancestry (79), is also associated with nephropathy in patients with SCA (11, \\n78, 170). The true association is broadly considered to be with APOL1, owing both to \\nthe stronger statistical association with that gene and to the lack of identification of causal \\nfunctional variants in MYH9. The original association with MYH9 has been attributed to the \\nstrong linkage disequilibrium between MYH9 and APOL1.\\nIt must be said that, in general, the lack of replication in independent studies means that \\nmany of the published genetic associations remain somewhat questionable. Contributing \\nfactors include underpowered studies, a poor definition of phenotypes, and failure to control \\nWilliams and Thein Page 11\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet.

Of the published genetic associations, beyond α-thalassemia and those specific \\nto HbF, only two are strongly convincing: the association between UGT1A1 and bilirubin \\nlevels and predisposition to gallstones and the association between the MYH9-APOL1 locus \\nand sickle nephropathy, which are compelling because they have been replicated in different \\nSCA cohorts and confirmed in populations without SCA.\\nThe Management and Outcome of Sickle Cell Anemia In High-Income \\nCountries\\nA major evidence-based review of the management of SCA was recently undertaken by \\nthe US National Institutes of Health and published in 2014 (132, 223). A striking feature \\nof that report was that many recommendations are based on levels of evidence that are \\nless than high, reflecting the widespread paucity of data from randomized controlled trials. \\nFor many years, the cornerstones of treatment for the majority of patients affected by \\nSCA have been the prevention of bacterial infections and the management of complications \\nsuch as pain and end-organ damage. As stated above, without specific interventions, the \\nincidence of severe and fatal bacterial infections is extremely high, particularly in the early \\nyears of life (31). However, early mortality from severe bacterial infections has now been \\nall but eliminated by the widespread implementation of prophylaxis with penicillin during \\nthe 1970s and 1980s and by the subsequent introduction of specific vaccines for both S. \\npneumoniae and H. influenzae. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that these interventions \\ndo not completely eliminate the risk and that the incidence of invasive infections with \\nS. pneumoniae, particularly those caused by strains that are not covered by the standard \\npneumococcal vaccines, remains unacceptably high (119, 134). Although rates of invasive \\npneumonococcal disease fell by 65% in US children with SCD following the introduction \\nof the PCV7 vaccine (120), a recent study from Minnesota reported an incidence that is \\nstill 18 times that reported among children without SCA in the postvaccine era (119). \\nSuch studies bring into question the practice of discontinuing penicillin at 5 years of age, \\nparticularly given the low level of evidence on which this practice is based (69, 132, 223). \\nParvovirus B19 infection, the cause of a mild flu-like illness (the so-called fifth disease) \\nin children without SCA, can have serious consequences in patients with SCA. The most \\ncommon manifestation is a transient but potentially fatal erythrocyte aplasia that can lead \\nto acute severe anemia (174), but infections can also contribute to the development of ACS \\nand nephrotic syndrome (162). As a consequence, for some years there has been interest \\nin the development of a parvovirus B19 vaccine for use in children with SCA. A leading \\ncandidate currently in preclinical development, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae–derived virus-\\nlike particle-based vaccine, was immunogenic in both wild-type mice (43) and a mouse \\nmodel for SCA (150).\\nEstablished Treatments for Sickle Cell Anemia\\nFor many years, specific treatments for the majority of patients with SCA have been limited \\nto the provision of analgesics during painful crises and blood transfusions for particular \\nindications, including episodes of ACS or severe acute anemia (132, 223). Two additional \\nWilliams and Thein Page 12\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptstreatments—long-term transfusion therapy with iron chelation and hydroxyurea—have been \\nreserved largely for patients with specific complications. However, informed by the growing \\nappreciation of the pathophysiological processes that underlie the complications of SCA, an \\nincreasing number of newer drugs and treatments are now being developed, some of which \\ncould potentially prevent or reverse the course of SCA.\\nHydroxyurea\\nUntil very recently, hydroxyurea was the only disease-modifying drug ever to be licensed \\nfor the treatment of SCA by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hydroxyurea was \\noriginally used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the management of malignancies, but its \\npotential benefits as a treatment for SCA were first recognized more than 30 years ago \\n(157). Hydroxyurea is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in DNA \\nsynthesis (65), and this appears to be key to its numerous therapeutic effects. Hydroxyurea \\nhas many of the attributes of an ideal drug for SCA because it has multiple mechanisms \\nof action that affect various points on the pathophysiological pathway described above. \\nWhen administered once daily at the correct dose (typically 15–30 mg/kg, as determined \\nby titration against hematological response indices), hydroxyurea leads to therapeutic \\nreductions in neutrophils, reticulocytes, platelet counts, and inflammatory cytokines, all \\nof which have been implicated in the process of vasoocclusion. Finally, hydroxyurea \\ncommonly (but not universally) results in the therapeutic induction of HbF, the beneficial \\neffects of which were discussed in detail above. Together, these mechanisms lead to lower \\nlevels of hemolysis (a process implicated in endovascular injury), a consequent increase in \\nsteady-state hemoglobin, and improved rheology of erythrocytes and neutrophils through \\nreduced vascular cytoadherence (210). Nevertheless, although these protean benefits of \\nhydroxyurea have been documented through multiple clinical trials conducted in both adults \\nand children, its introduction into routine treatment has been surprisingly slow, and uptake in \\nsome countries (including well-resourced ones) remains relatively low.\\nChronic Transfusion Therapy\\nChronic transfusion therapy has long been shown to reduce the risk of strokes in children \\nwho are at increased risk on the basis of TCD monitoring (3). In the Stroke Prevention \\nTrial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP), transfusion therapy was associated with a 92% \\nreduction in the risk of overt stroke among children with TCD velocities of ≥200 cm/s \\nand also reduced the risk of further strokes in children with existing silent infarcts (53). \\nHowever, the discontinuation of transfusion therapy is associated with a high rate of \\nreversion to abnormal TCD velocities and a high risk of further strokes (111, 144). The \\nStroke with Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) trial showed that continued \\ntransfusions with chelation therapy were superior to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy in the \\nmanagement of children with an existing stroke and iron overload (212), but the recently \\ncompleted Transcranial Doppler with Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (TWiTCH) \\ntrial asked whether hydroxyurea could be used as an alternative approach to primary stroke \\nprevention in high-risk children. Because it is currently the standard of care, all children \\nwere first established on transfusion therapy; however, TWiTCH showed that, in children \\nwho have been transfused for at least one year, switching to hydroxyurea was as effective as \\ncontinuing transfusions in terms of TCD velocities (211).\\nWilliams and Thein Page 13\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsBlood transfusion remains an essential element in the management of patients with SCA, \\nand indications for blood transfusion are expanding (59), but it is not without risk. Common \\ncomplications include secondary iron overload and hemolytic transfusion reactions caused \\nby the development of red blood cell antigen alloimmunization, and transmission of \\ninfections remains a significant issue in many countries (46). The most feared complication \\nis alloimmunization to red blood cell antigens, which is relatively more common in patients \\nwith SCA and can lead to difficulties in sourcing appropriately matched blood products, \\ndelayed transfusion reactions, significant morbidities, and even fatalities in some cases (52, \\n204). Clinician awareness of delayed transfusion reactions is poor because symptoms mimic \\nacute vasoocclusive pain and immunohematology findings are often negative. One possible \\nreason for the relatively high incidence of alloimmunization observed in the SCA population \\nis the mismatch in the red blood cell antigens expressed in patients of African descent and \\ndonors of primarily northern European descent (224). However, despite ethnic matching, a \\nsignificant proportion of SCApatients still became alloimmunized (47). Molecular analyses \\nof the RH genes in SCA patients and African American donors revealed remarkable RH \\nallelic diversity in this population and mismatch between serologic Rh phenotype and RHD \\nor RHCE genotype owing to variant RH alleles in 87% of individuals (47). As a prevention, \\nmany blood transfusion centers have adopted extended red cell phenotyping, including \\nABO, Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and S and s antigens, and some centers have also adopted \\nmolecular genotyping for red blood cell phenotype prediction using microarray chips (e.g., \\nthe PreciseType HEA BeadChip assay).\\nNew Treatments for Sickle Cell Anemia\\nAs stated above, until very recently, the management of SCA was largely reactive. \\nComplications, particularly painful crises, have been managed as they occur, and preventive \\ntreatments have been limited largely to hydroxyurea and blood transfusion. In the last two \\ndecades, however, the situation has changed dramatically with the development of new drugs \\nand treatments for specific types of crisis and of other drugs that are aimed at preventing \\nor reversing the development of complications altogether. To some extent, this reflects the \\ngrowing realization that even in patients with a seemingly mild phenotype, ongoing chronic \\nhemolytic anemia is a pathological driver of insidious end-organ damage. The recent surge \\nin new drugs has also been helped by the designation of SCA as an orphan disease (a disease \\nthat affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States), with the result that drugs that \\nare developed for its treatment benefit from the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which allows \\nfor significant financial incentives. The most significant new drugs for the prevention and \\ntreatment of SCA are summarized in Table 3 and discussed in further detail below.\\nThe Prevention of Polymerization\\nAs discussed above, the polymerization of deoxy-HbS is the root cause of the downstream \\nconsequences of SCA. The development of a drug that prevents or mitigates this \\npolymerization could therefore be transformative. Several approaches have been considered, \\nas summarized in a recent comprehensive review (64). The best established is the induction \\nof HbF synthesis, which holds particular promise because there is plentiful evidence \\nof efficacy from clinical and epidemiological studies. As discussed above, the onset of \\nWilliams and Thein Page 14\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptssymptoms among children with SCA is delayed for several months, until HbF is replaced \\nby HbS. Moreover, the proportion of HbF beyond that point is one of few factors that \\ncorrelates closely with outcome. Finally, it is believed that the induction of HbF is a \\nmajor element in the effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy. Alternative approaches to HbF \\ninduction are under investigation, and several drugs have entered clinical trials. Advances \\nin our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the switch from fetal to adult \\nglobin-gene expression have led to the generation of new agents that fall into two main \\ngroups: those that affect chromatin regulators (such as decitabine on DNA methylation \\nand histone deacetylase inhibitors) and those that affect DNA-binding transcription factors. \\nBCL11A is a potent repressor of HbF but has important roles in neuronal development \\nand B cell function. Lineage-specific, microRNA-mediated short hairpin RNA suppression \\nof BCL11A in erythroid cells led to stable long-term engraftment of gene-modified cells \\nand increases in HbF (33). Dissection of the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer down \\nto a small region in intron 2 of the gene offers the possibility of disrupting this region \\nand specifically targeting erythroid function using genome-editing technology such as zinc-\\nfinger nucleases or CRISPR/Cas9 (37, 205). It might also be possible to derepress γ-globin \\nexpression by forcing interaction of the β-locus control region with the γ-globin gene using \\na synthetic DNA-binding protein (32, 56). This forced chromosomal looping approach has \\nthe advantage that βS-globin expression is reduced concomitantly with increased γ-globin \\nexpression.\\nIn addition to agents aimed at inducing HbF production, drugs designed to inhibit \\npolymerization directly are under development. In theory, it should be possible to prevent \\npolymerization through the use of small molecules designed to block the sites at which \\nthe α- and βS-globin chains bind during this process, and although no candidates have yet \\nbeen identified, this approach remains the target of active research (64). 5-Hydroxymethyl-\\nfurfural (Aes-103) is a naturally occurring aldehyde that binds to the N-terminal valine \\nresidue of the α-globin chain of HbS and results in a dose-dependent increase in its oxygen \\naffinity (140). Effective at preventing polymerization in vitro, Aes-103 was well tolerated \\nand apparently safe in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial conducted in adults (140). Although \\nthe final analysis is not yet complete, early results from a phase 2 trial (NCT01987908) \\nshow no obvious benefit of Aes-103 over placebo, and as a result, the trial was terminated \\nearly. However, the study was designed to address dose and safety as opposed to efficacy, \\nwith three-quarters of participants randomized to the active drug; further trials will therefore \\nbe needed to determine its utility. A second drug has since been developed that acts through \\nthe same mechanism but with higher specificity and at lower concentrations (123, 142). \\nGBT440 is a polyaromatic aldehyde that was safe in early phase trials and was associated \\nwith a dose-dependent increase in hemoglobin, decreased reticulocytes, irreversibly sickled \\ncell counts, and serum bilirubin concentrations, consistent with reduced levels of early \\nhemolysis. Multicenter phase 3 clinical studies of GBT440 are now being launched in both \\nadults (NCT03036813) and children (NCT02850406), the results of which are awaited with \\nconsiderable interest.\\nWhile two further approaches to the prevention of sickling showed early promise, neither \\nproved effective in clinical trials. The kinetics of HbS polymerization are exquisitely \\nsensitive to HbS concentration, and in theory, reducing the intracellular concentration of \\nWilliams and Thein Page 15\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet.

While early results were promising in terms of markers of reduced \\nhemolysis and improved erythrocyte survival (14), a phase 3 trial proved negative in terms \\nof efficacy in the prevention of vasoocclusive crises (13). Finally, Sanguinate, a bovine \\nPEGylated hemoglobin product, was designed to block the polymerization of HbS through \\nthe delivery of carbon monoxide, a potent antisickling agent. Sanguinate is administered \\nintravenously, and its potential benefits are limited to the treatment of vasoocclusive events. \\nA phase 1 trial found sufficient evidence of safety (125) to allow its progression to a phase 2 \\ntrial (NCT02411708).\\nPreventing and Reversing Vasoocclusion\\nSeveral drugs that have been designed to target the general area of vasoocclusion are in \\nvarious stages of development, some of which have shown considerable promise in clinical \\ntrials. The recently described involvement of endothelial adhesion molecules has led to \\nthe development of several specific inhibitors, with a particular focus on the selectins. \\nCrizanlizumab, an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody that targets P-selectin, \\nhas shown efficacy in both the prevention and reversal of the sequestration process in in \\nvitro models, and results from early trials in humans have been promising. Most recently, \\na placebo-controlled trial [the Study to Assess Safety and Impact of SelG1 with or without \\nHydroxyurea Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease Patients With Pain Crises (SUSTAIN)] of \\nhigh-dose crizanlizumab (5.0 mg/kg), administered intravenously 14 times over a period \\nof 52 weeks, found that patients treated with the active drug had a 45.3% lower rate of \\ncrises (P = 0.01) (12). Crizanlizumab had an additive effect in patients who were receiving \\nconcomitant hydroxyurea. Among patients receiving hydroxyurea, those given high-dose \\ncrizanlizumab had an annual crisis rate that was 32.1% lower than those given a placebo.\\nStem Cell Transplantation and Gene Therapy\\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become an increasingly acceptable \\ntreatment option for SCA. An analysis of 1,000 HLA-identical sibling donor transplantations \\nconducted between 1986 and 2013 has revealed excellent outcomes, with both children \\nand adults demonstrating 93% (95% confidence interval 91.1–94.6%) overall survival (82). \\nModifications to the intensity of conditioning have expanded allogeneic hematopoietic \\nstem cell transplantation as a treatment option for adult patients with preexisting organ \\ndysfunction, who would have been otherwise ineligible for transplantation using standard \\nmyeloablative conditioning (99). However, less than 14% of patients with SCA have HLA-\\nmatched siblings as potential donors. Alternative sources of half-matched (haplo-identical) \\nfamily donors have therefore been actively explored to make hematopoietic stem cell \\ntransplantation available to more patients (30).\\nGene therapy using genetically modified patient-derived (i.e., autologous) hematopoietic \\nstem cells would avoid the risk of graft-versus-host disease and could therefore be \\napplicable to many more patients (40, 84). Several gene therapy approaches are being \\nexplored. One approach is that of gene addition using lentiviral vectors (β-like globin \\nWilliams and Thein Page 16\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptstransgenes, short hairpin RNA for erythroid-specific expression, and lentiviral expression \\nof a ZF-LDB1 fusion protein). The most advanced of these is the antisickling β-globin \\nvector containing the HbAT87Q mutation (Bluebird Bio), which was first tested in a patient \\nwith transfusion-dependent HbE/β-thalassemia (41). The first case of SCA treated by this \\napproach reported therapeutic levels (>50%) of antisickling β-hemoglobin, no evidence \\nof insertional mutagenesis, an absence of crises, and the correction of disease hallmarks \\n(166). Interim results from a phase 1/2 study using this same vector revealed therapeutic \\nhemoglobin HbAT87Q expression in all seven patients with SCD. These data should reassure \\npatients regarding the short-term safety of gene therapy, although long-term safety remains \\nan open question.\\nThe other gene therapy approach is gene editing. SCA presents an ideal opportunity for \\ngene editing because of its SNP-based etiology, but the method involves nuclease-induced \\nhomology-directed repair, which is highly inefficient. Much more promising are approaches \\nthat cause the disruption by nonhomologous end joining of the erythroid-specific enhancer \\nin the γ-globin repressor (BCL11A); however, this method is error prone. The creation \\nof mutations in the HBB complex to simulate natural hereditary persistence of fetal \\nhemoglobin variants by gene editing is another approach under active investigation (193, \\n215).\\nCurrent Perspectives in Low-Income Settings\\nWhile many of the exciting developments that we have outlined above hold great promise \\nfor improving the lives of patients born with SCA in high-income countries, the current \\nreality is very different for the vast majority of patients who are born with SCA in \\nlow-income regions, where, until very recently, the condition has been almost completely \\nneglected as a health priority. No country within these regions has yet established a national \\nscreening program, and as a result, most patients come to medical attention only when they \\npresent with complications. As many as 90% therefore die, usually undiagnosed, during \\nthe first 5 years of life (87). As a consequence, in many parts of Africa, SCA is probably \\nresponsible for an astonishing 5–16% of total mortality under age 5 (127). Only a small \\nfraction of all research into SCA is conducted in the regions most affected, meaning that, to \\na great extent, the guidelines that are in place are not grounded in the local context.\\nThe last few years, however, have seen several welcome developments. The importance of \\nSCA has been formally recognized by multiple international organizations, including the \\nUnited Nations and the World Health Organization (197, 220). Moreover, bodies like the \\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the US National Institutes of Health are starting \\nto appreciate the importance of better funding through the establishment of specific funding \\ncalls (133). Further collaboration among governments, scientists, and international funding \\norganizations is badly needed if the plight of the majority of the world’s SCA population is \\nto be improved in the years ahead.\\nWilliams and Thein Page 17\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsConclusions\\nIn the century since SCA was first formally recognized in the scientific literature, it has been \\nat the forefront of numerous scientific discoveries. To a large extent, the translation of these \\ndiscoveries into new drugs and treatments has been much less impressive, partly because of \\nthe low number and marginalized status of those affected in resource-rich regions. In recent \\nyears, however, improvements in survival in conjunction with a growing appreciation of the \\ntrue burden of this condition more globally have led to a greater focus on the translation of \\nscientific knowledge into new therapies that could soon transform the outlook for affected \\npatients regardless of where they live. Perhaps most exciting are gene therapy approaches \\nthat now hold the promise of complete cure, although a great deal more will need to be \\nlearned about the balance of risk and benefit before such treatments can be rolled out to any \\nbut the most severely affected. In the meantime, a concerted effort to discover and develop \\nnew drugs aimed at preventing the complications of SCA is still justified, because such \\napproaches will probably come with fewer risks at a lower cost and will be accessible to a \\nbroader range of patients.\\nAcknowledgments\\nT.N.W. is funded by the Wellcome Trust through Senior Research Fellowship 202800.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) has been at the vanguard of human genetic \\ndiscovery since its recognition by Linus Pauling as the first example of a \\nmolecular disease in 1949.\\n2. The identification of genetic variants of hemoglobin F as important \\nphenotypic modifiers provided early proof of principle that genome-\\nwide association studies could contribute meaningfully to therapeutic \\ndevelopments.\\n3. Genetic and genomic developments are now translating to the development of \\nnew therapeutics that may radically reduce disease morbidity.\\n4. A cure for this chronic and debilitating disease is now within reach through \\nstem cell transplantation, gene therapy, and gene editing.\\n5. Much more remains to be done for the vast majority of affected patients who \\nare born in low-income regions within Africa and India.\\nWilliams and Thein Page 31\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsFuture Issues\\n1. Although it seems likely that curative therapies such as gene editing and stem \\ncell transplantation will gain traction in the years ahead, a range of issues, \\nincluding safety, cost, and timing, mean that new disease-modifying drugs \\nwill be needed for the foreseeable future.\\n2. SCA has evolved from a life-threatening disease of childhood into a chronic \\ndisease in adults, with many unmet needs.\\n3. Morbidity and mortality remain significant problems. The life expectancy of \\nsomeone with SCA still lags behind that of others without SCA by more than \\n20 years.\\n4. An inequity of treatment exists not only between high- and low-income \\ncountries, but also within well-resourced countries.\\n5. There is a need to develop a network of experts who could serve as resources \\nfor community-based providers.\\n6. Prediction of disease severity remains an issue; we need more, and better, \\nbiomarkers and genetic markers to allow us to focus the potentially toxic \\ntreatments (hydroxyurea, stem cell transplant, and gene therapy) on those \\npatients with high-risk disease.\\n7. It is now clear that all patients with SCA, however mild their symptoms \\nappear to be, are continuously undergoing some degree of chronic end-organ \\ndeterioration. It is therefore crucial that new drugs target the mechanisms that \\nlead to this end-organ damage.\\n8. As new drugs and treatments are developed, it will be essential to find ways to \\nmake them available to patients in low-income countries who stand to benefit \\nmost.\\nWilliams and Thein Page 32\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet.

Cancer cells may \\ntake advantage of these checkpoints to escape detection \\nby the immune system. Some of these checkpoints such \\nas cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) \\nand programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have been \\nextensively studied as targets in the frame of the so-\\ncalled cancer immunotherapy\\n[1]\\n. CTLA-4 counteracts \\nthe activity of the T cell co-stimulatory receptor CD28 \\nand actively delivers inhibitory signals to the T cell\\n[2]\\n. \\nPD-1 has two ligands, PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and PDL2, \\nand its inhibitory effect is accomplished through a dual \\nmechanism of promoting apoptosis in antigen specific \\nT-cells in lymph nodes while simultaneously reducing \\napoptosis in regulatory T cells (suppressor T cells)\\n[3]\\n. In \\nthe last few years, the blockade of immune checkpoints \\nhas disclosed the potential of the antitumor immune \\nresponse in a fashion that is transforming human cancer \\ntherapeutics. CTLA4 antibodies such as ipilimumab \\nand tremelimumab have been tested in the last ten \\nyears in different types of cancer , starting with patients \\nwith advanced melanoma\\n[4]\\n. Ipilimumab was the first \\ntherapy to demonstrate a survival benefit for patients \\nwith metastatic melanoma. In a study by Hodi et al\\n[5]\\n, \\nipilimumab significantly improved overall survival in \\npatients with previously treated metastatic melanoma \\nand the drug was approved by the United States Food \\nand Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of \\nadvanced melanoma in 2011\\n[5]\\n. Similarly, nivolumab, \\na humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has \\ndemonstrated durable responses in several phase III \\ntrials and has received FDA approval in specific clinical \\nsettings in patients with melanoma, renal cell cancer , \\nHodgkin’s lymphoma, bladder cancer , and non-small \\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC)\\n[6-9]\\n. Figure 1 summarizes the \\nmechanisms of action of the two FDA approved immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICPIs).\\nEvaluation of response to ICPIs \\nHistorically, the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \\nTumors (RECIST) has been validated and used to eva-\\nluate antitumor responses to chemotherapeutic agents\\n[10]\\n \\n(T able 1 for a more detailed description). These criteria \\nare based on dimensional evaluation and rely on the \\nfact that the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents \\ntends to translate into measurable effects in terms of \\ntumor shrinkage from baseline. Furthermore, published \\nstudies indicated that achieving a response according to \\nRECIST criteria is predictive of remission and improved \\nsurvival in specific settings\\n[11]\\n. Conversely, both RECIST \\nand their revised 1.1 version assumed that an early \\nincrease in tumor growth and/or the appearance of \\nnew lesions correspond to progressive disease (PD), \\ntestifying drug failure and indicating the need of ongoing \\ntreatment cessation\\n[10]\\n.\\nSome exceptions for the use of these criteria have \\nbeen already suggested in patients treated with target \\ntherapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors as in this \\ngroup of patients the lack of tumor shrinkage in the \\npresence of a stable disease has been identified as a \\npotential surrogate end point for improved clinical out-\\ncome\\n[12]\\n. However , in the clinical practice, the radiolo-\\ngical effect of immunotherapeutic agents has raised \\nseveral more relevant and complex challenges for \\nthe determination of their imaging-based response at \\nsingle patient level\\n[13]\\n. In published studies, while some \\npatients have responded to ICPIs with the expected \\ntumor shrinkage (chemo-like response) or with a \\nstable disease (target therapy-like response), other \\ndistinct immune-related patterns of response have been \\nidentified. In particular , an initial increase in tumor size, \\ndevelopment of new lesions and then a delayed objective \\nresponse were also observed in patients treated with \\nimmunotherapeutic agents\\n[13]\\n. Specifically, in some \\npatients, the initial increase in total tumor burden was \\nproven to be due to inflammatory cell infiltrates by \\nmeans of biopsy. In these patients the initial pseudo-\\nprogression was followed by a decrease in tumor burden \\nor even disease regression. \\nAs RECIST criteria were not suitable to catch \\nthese atypical responses, the so-called immune-\\nrelated response criteria (irRC) have been proposed to \\nprovide more rigorous characterization of all patterns \\nof response observed in the phase II development \\nprogram for ipilimumab in melanoma\\n[13-15]\\n (Table 1). \\nThe main differences between RECIST 1.1 and irRC \\nrely on the fact that, according to irRC, appearance of \\nnew lesions (PD according to the RECIST criteria) will \\nonly result in progressive disease in case of a significant \\n(≥ 25%) increase in total tumor burden with respect \\nto baseline. Moreover, different from conventional \\ncriteria, if irRC-based PD is evident, it requires further \\nconfirmation after one month with the aim of capturing 29 February 28, 2017|Volume 9|Issue 2|WJR|www.wjgnet.com\\ndelayed response.\\nRecently, Hodi et al\\n[16]\\n evaluated atypical response \\npatterns and reported the overall survival data in \\ncorrelation with irRC and RECIST criteria in the context \\nof a retrospective analysis of 327 melanoma patients \\ntreated with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. This \\nstudy indicated that the conventional RECIST assessment \\nalone tends to underestimate the benefit of PD-1 inhibi-\\ntor therapy in a subset of patients, supporting a need of \\nimmune-related response evaluation\\n[16]\\n. IrRC are thus \\nincreasingly proposed, but they have not been validated \\nyet in the context of clinical trials and most trials \\ninvolving ICPIs continue to use RECIST 1.1 to obtain \\nstandardized endpoints for regulatory approvals\\n[15]\\n. \\nHowever, although the irRC seem better than \\nRECIST , the former has some limitations. The irRC use \\nthe bidimensional measurements in line with WHO \\ncriteria that are now rarely used in clinical trials and \\nreplaced by the unidimensional measurement of the \\nlarger axis of target lesions (RECIST 1.0 and 1.1). The \\nbidimensional measurements introduce a greater vari-\\nability than unidimensional measurements and make it \\ndifficult to compare the responses with studies using the \\nRECIST criteria.\\nIs there a role for \\n18\\nF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron \\nemission tomography in the evaluation of ICPIs?\\nWhile optimal CT-based response criteria for ICPIs \\nare in the path of their identification, very few data \\nare available for the evaluation of immunotherapy by \\nmeans of \\n18\\nF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emis-\\nsion tomography (\\n18\\nF-FDG-PET), one of the most used \\nimaging techniques in oncology. \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET is currently \\nthe most widely used molecular imaging modality in \\nthe clinical practice for staging and restaging of several \\ncancers. \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET is clinically indicated before and \\nafter treatment in patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma \\nand NSCLC and it is used in patients with melanoma for \\nFigure 1  Schematic representation of mechanism of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab, two Food and Drug Administration approved immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitors. To prevent autoimmunity, numerous checkpoint pathways regulate the activation of T cells at multiple steps (process known as peripheral \\ntolerance). Central in this process are the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints pathways. \\nCTLA-4 is potentially able to stop autoreactive T cells at the initial stage of naive T-cell activation, typically in lymph nodes, while PD-1 regulates previously activated \\nT cells at the later stages of an immune response in peripheral tissues. The binding between T-cell receptor (TCR), which is expressed on T cell surface, with major \\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) provides specificity to T-cell activation. However, T cell activation requires more than \\none stimulatory signal. Among them a central role is played by the binding between B7 molecules (APC) with CD28 (T-Cell). CTLA-4 is a CD28 homolog which does \\nnot produce a stimulatory signal but inhibits TCR-MHC binding and thus the T-Cell activation. Different from T-cells in which the amount of CTLA-4 is low, T-Regs \\nhighly express CTLA-4. In these cells CTLA-4 might play a role in their suppressive functions. PD-1 is a member of the B7/CD38 family of protein, which is able to \\nbind with two different ligands: Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2). PD-1 activation in a T-cell prevents the phosphorylation \\nof key TCR signaling intermediates and thus T-cell activation, resulting in suboptimal control of infections and cancers. Therefore, even though they act at different \\nphases of T-cell activation, the negative effect of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T-cell activity is similar. Moreover, different from CTLA-4, PD-1 expression is not specific in \\nT-cells, but can be observed also in B-cells and myeloid cells. The rationale for immune checkpoint inhibition (represented in red) for cancer treatment is that CTLA-4 \\nand PD1 pathways are strictly related to cancer survival and thus targeting these molecules or their ligands with monoclonal antibodies permits to impact on cancer \\ngrowth. Therefore, even if the exact mechanism of action of these monoclonal antibodies in the antitumor response remains unclear, research data suggest that it is at \\nleast partially related to an activation and proliferation of T-cells regardless of TCR specificity (due to the inhibition of the inhibitory activity of these checkpoints), which \\nenhances the anti-cancer immune reaction. \\nT Reg\\nAntigen\\npresenting cell\\nCancer cell\\nT cell\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nMHC\\nCTLA-4\\nTCR\\nIPILMUMAB\\nNIVOLUMAB\\nCD28\\nCD28\\nCD28\\nCTLA-4 CTLA-4\\nPD-1\\nPD-1\\nPD-1\\nPD-L1\\nPD-L1\\nPD-L1\\nMHC\\nMHC\\nBauckneht M et al.

The use of \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET \\nin post-treatment settings is based on the assumption \\nthat tumor size changes are only the final step in a \\nsequence of complex metabolic and functional processes \\nduring and after treatment\\n[20]\\n. Two different types \\nof criteria have been proposed for the identification \\nof \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET-based response in solid tumors: The \\nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of \\nCancer (EORTC) and the PET Response Criteria in Solid \\nTumors (PERCIST) criteria\\n[21,22]\\n (Table 1). Both criteria \\ntarget the most metabolically active part of patient’s \\ntumor burden, which is regarded as the most viable and \\naggressive disease site. In both cases, the so-called \\nstandardized uptake value (SUV) is measured at baseline \\nand after treatment. However , they differ for some rele-\\nvant aspects. The EORTC criteria were published in 1999 \\nand are based on the evaluation of a lesion-specific \\nregion of interest (ROI) chosen as the most \\n18\\nF-FDG-avid \\nat baseline and followed in the after-treatment scans\\n[22]\\n. \\nThe PERCIST criteria were proposed in 2009 by Wahl \\net al\\n[21]\\n and rely on the use of a 1 cm\\n3\\n ROI on the most \\n18\\nF-FDG-avid part of the single most metabolically active \\nlesion at each PET/CT scan (which is not necessarily \\nlocated in the same lesion in all scans). \\nRelatively few papers have compared the two \\nmethods in solid tumors and good agreement, similar \\nresponses and survival outcomes have been highlighted \\nin the available studies\\n[23]\\n. However, for the EORTC \\ncriteria, no recommendations on the number of target \\nlesions or on whether computing SUV max or average \\nSUV for response calculation are given while the \\nPERCIST criteria recommend the use of lean body mass \\nfor SUV normalization (SUL). In this framework, some \\nstudies have demonstrated a higher accuracy with \\nrespect to RECIST for both metabolic response based \\ncriteria in patients treated with target therapies such as \\nerlotinib. This finding is due to the relative lower tumor \\nshrinkage characterizing this type of treatment\\n[24]\\n. \\nSimilarly, an \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET-based five-point scale (5-PS), \\nthe so-called Deauville criteria, has been demonstrated \\nto be superior to CT-based response by scoring images \\nin the assessment of response at the middle and end of \\ntreatment in HD patients\\n[18]\\n. Again these findings testify \\nthat functional changes always precede morphological \\nchanges in the course of pathological processes. In \\nthis regard it might be of interest to test the complex \\nand variegated response to ICPIs by means of PET-\\nbased criteria. In fact, on one hand, functional imaging \\nmay capture different features of treatment with ICPIs \\nin terms of entity and time course of response.

Accordingly, given \\nthe well-known high metabolic activity characterizing \\ninflammatory cells, this feature may also hamper the \\nevaluation of \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET-based response to ICPIs. \\nSachpekidis et al\\n[20]\\n evaluated the role of \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET/CT after two cycles of ipilimumab in predicting the \\nfinal response to therapy in 22 patients with metastatic \\nmelanoma. They evaluated response to treatment by \\nmeans of the EORTC criteria and found that \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET/CT after two cycles of ipilimumab is predictive of \\nthe final treatment outcome in patients with progressive \\nmetabolic disease (PMD) and stable metabolic disease \\n(SMD)\\n[20]\\n. However , two patients were initially falsely \\nclassified as early SMD, but they later demonstrated \\nnew metastatic lesions, “upgrading” them to late PMD. \\nSimilarly, early evaluation by means of \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET \\ndid not identify responders to treatment as the two \\npatients eventually characterized with PMR were initially \\nclassified with early PMD due to new lesions\\n[20]\\n. In fact, \\nboth RECIST 1.1 and PET-based criteria consider the \\nidentification of new (metabolically active) lesions as \\nprogressive disease. Therefore, presently proposed \\nPET-based metabolic criteria suffer from at least one \\nof the same limitations that have resulted in the under-\\nestimation of response to treatment with ICPIs by \\nmeans of RECIST 1.1. Similarly, in the phase 2 study \\nby Younes et al\\n[9]\\n, nivolumab resulted in frequent res-\\nponses in patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma \\nafter failure of ASCT and brentuximab vedotin. Most of \\nthese responses were maintained through the reported \\nfollow-up period with an acceptable safety profile. In \\nthis study \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET was performed at baseline and \\nat weeks 17 and 25. A negative \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET scan, \\nvisually assessed by an independent radiological review \\ncommittee (IRRC), was required for confirmation \\nof complete remission. The study demonstrated a \\ngeneral reduction of tumor burden. Yet, discordance \\nin complete remission between IRRC and investigator \\nassessments was largely based on the interpretation \\nof \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET scans and standardized uptake values \\nwere not collected as part of this study. The vast \\nmajority of other available data on the potential utility \\nof \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET after ICPIs are case reports more \\noften describing underlying challenges of monitoring \\nradiologic response in these patients and showing \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET features of inflammatory reactions. PET-\\nhighlighted autoimmune pancolitis, splenic sarcoidosis-\\nlike lesion and exacerbation of sarcoidosis as a potential \\nconfounder in the assessment of tumor response in \\na melanoma patient treated with ipilimumab have all \\nbeen described\\n[25-27]\\n. Similarly, Koo et al\\n[26]\\n illustrated a \\nseries of inflammatory reactions with avid FDG uptake \\nin patients treated with ipilimumab, including those with \\nthyroiditis, hypophysitis, granulomatous inflammation in \\nthe lymph nodes and skin, and enterocolitis. \\nAccordingly, the potential and challenges of \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET imaging in the evaluation of patients treated with \\nICPIs still need to be clarified and deeply addressed. \\nGiven the relatively greater experience of CT-based \\nevaluation in this setting and the fact that irRC CT-\\nbased criteria seem to better in capturing response to \\nICPIs, it is worthwhile to ask if a similar modification of \\nPET-based criteria could be proposed in the future.\\nPotential new PET-based approaches to evaluate the \\neffect of ICPIs\\nAs mentioned above, due to its intrinsic nature, \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET displays not only cancer cell’s metabolic activity but \\nalso inflammation. Since the antineoplastic activity of \\nICPIs is highly related to the activation of T cells against \\ncancer cells, \\n18\\nF-FDG accumulation might cause false-\\npositive findings. Yet, discrimination between benign \\nand malignant processes represents a huge challenge \\nfor \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET in this clinical setting. Together with the \\nneed of the clinicians to discriminate between responders \\nand non-responders, allowing individual therapy \\noptimization and avoiding adverse effects brought \\nabout by ineffective therapy, several studies have been \\nrecently conducted to explore the possible role of non-\\nFDG radiotracers in the field of ICPIs. These studies, \\nmainly performed with labeled monoclonal antibodies, \\nopen the new era of the so-called “Immuno-PET”. \\nAccordingly, in 2014, Higashikawa et al\\n[28]\\n developed \\na molecular imaging probe that is able to evaluate \\nCTLA-4 expression prior to CTLA-4 targeting in cancer . \\nThis \\n64\\nCu labeled radiotracer is basically composed \\nof DOTA protein together with a CTLA-4 specific \\nantibody and is able to display CTLA-4 expression \\nin vivo. Similarly, specific experimental radiotracers \\nwere proposed for the visualization of PD-1 and PD-L1 \\ncellular expression\\n[29-32]\\n. Maute et al\\n[29]\\n measured PD-L1 \\nexpression by radiolabeling a PD-L1 high affinity protein \\n(HAC) with \\n64\\nCu and tested its feasibility in a living \\nmouse, while Hettich et al\\n[30]\\n developed two \\n64\\nCu labeled \\nimmunoPET tracers for imaging of both PD-1 and PD-L1. \\nAlso one SPECT study with radiolabeled anti-murine \\nPD-L1 in mice has been conducted\\n[32]\\n. More recently, a \\n89\\nZr labeled CD3 PET imaging agent was proposed by \\nLarimer et al\\n[33]\\n. CD3 is a part of the TCR complex that \\nserves as a global T lymphocyte marker . By serving as \\na marker of total T-cell infiltration, CD3 may represent \\na more direct approach than pre-treatment biopsy \\nor genetic screening to monitoring tumor immune \\nresponse, by directly examining active recruitment of \\nT cells responsible for cancer cell death. In this study \\nthe authors showed that CD3 PET imaging revealed \\ntwo distinct groups of mice, stratified by PET signal \\nintensity. While high-CD3 PET uptake was correlated \\nwith subsequent reduced tumor volume, low uptake was \\npredictive of suboptimal response. Altogether these non-\\ninvasive approaches allow simultaneous imaging of the \\nentire cancer mass and associated metastases, which \\nmay differ from the primary tumor in CTLA-4, PD-1 or \\nPD-L1 expression status. Immune imaging can be used \\nfor repeated assessment of the same tumor at different \\nBauckneht M et al.

Furthermore, although further investigations \\nare needed before their potential introduction in the \\nclinical setting, these non-invasive immune-diagnostic \\napproaches might yield novel insights into the biology \\nand pathophysiological importance of ICPIs as cancer \\ntherapeutics. \\nREFERENCES\\n1 Pardoll DM .

A more detailed understanding of the switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin and \\nthe identification of regulators such as BCL11A provide hope that these findings will be translated \\ninto genomic-based approaches to the therapeutic reactivation of hemoglobin F production in \\npatients with SCA.

SCA was subsequently \\nheralded as the first “molecular disease” when Pauling et al. (149) ascribed its basis to the \\npresence of an abnormal hemoglobin, hemoglobin S (HbS), in 1949. In 1957, Ingram (100) \\ndiscovered that HbS was caused by a single amino acid substitution (glutamic acid changed \\nto valine) at position 6 of the β-globin chain of hemoglobin, and in 1963, Goldstein et al. \\n(83) showed that this amino acid substitution arose from a single base change (A>T) at \\ncodon 6 (rs334). SCA, therefore, has always been at the forefront of molecular medicine and \\narguably launched the whole field of human molecular genetics. Because of this disease’s \\ngenetic simplicity, being caused by a single change in a single gene, it has been used to \\nillustrate and validate many of the advances in this field, including proof-of-principle studies \\nin DNA diagnostics, predictive genetics, and population and epidemiological genetics (104, \\n146, 167, 171). The contribution of genetic modifiers to its extreme clinical heterogeneity \\nmade SCA an exemplar of the effects of genetic background on a single-gene disease. More \\nrecently, SCA has demonstrated the potential for genome-wide association studies in the \\ndiscovery of interacting genes that might be of clinical or therapeutic significance. Genome-\\nwide association studies of HbF, a quantitative trait that influences SCA severity, identified \\ntwo quantitative trait loci that are not linked to the HBB cluster: BCL11A and HBS1-MYB \\n(122, 195). These results have led to various genetic approaches to the reactivation of HbF \\nthat are now being explored as therapeutic options in SCA (96). Figure 1 shows a time line \\nof key genetic discoveries and significant events in SCA.\\nGiven its important role in scientific discovery, the process of translating such knowledge \\ninto new treatments has been far too slow, and for more than 30 years only two approaches \\nto disease modification—chronic blood transfusion and hydroxyurea therapy—have been \\nwidely deployed. However, more recently, a sea change in the therapeutic landscape \\nhas led to the development of numerous new drugs that target different aspects of the \\npathophysiology of SCA (189).\\nThe Molecular Basis of Sickle Cell Disease\\nThe term sickle cell disease (SCD) describes a clinical syndrome caused by the presence \\nof HbS. The genetic causes of SCD include homozygosity for the rs334 mutation (HbSS) \\n(generally known as SCA) and compound heterozygosity between rs334 and mutations \\nthat lead to either other structural variants of β-globin (such as HbC) or reduced levels \\nof β-globin production (β-thalassemia). In patients of African ancestry, SCA is the most \\ncommon cause of SCD (65–70%), followed by HbSC (about 30%), with HbS/β-thalassemia \\nbeing responsible for the majority of the balance. Although all forms of SCD are important, \\nSCA is by far the best described and is the sole focus of this review.\\nWilliams and Thein Page 2\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsThe Origins, Global Burden, and Distribution of Sickle Cell Anemia\\nThe heterozygous status of rs334 (coding for HbS) results in the sickle cell trait (HbAS), \\nin which erythrocytes contain a mixture of both normal HbA and HbS molecules. Through \\nmechanisms that have not been completely elucidated, such heterozygotes have a substantial \\nsurvival advantage in malaria-endemic environments. Large-scale genetic studies have \\nrecently revealed the extraordinary degree of this protection. In a study of almost 12,000 \\nsevere malaria cases and more than 17,000 controls conducted throughout Africa, Asia, \\nand Oceania, HbAS conferred an 86% reduction in the risk of severe malaria (odds ratio \\n0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.12–0.16) at a significance level (P = 1.6 × 10−225) rarely \\nseen in epidemiological studies (118). Furthermore, by preventing malaria, HbAS protects \\nfrom consequences of malaria such as undernutrition and fatal bacterial infections (172). \\nThese wide-ranging benefits have driven rs334 to high population frequencies throughout \\nmuch of the historically malaria-endemic world, so that carrier frequencies of 10–20% are \\nnow commonplace in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Middle East, and the \\nMediterranean basin (152) (Figure 2). Genetic analyses had suggested that rs334 arose and \\nwas amplified by selection separately in multiple populations (73), but a recent paper by \\nShriner & Rotimi (176a) has now provided evidence that it had a single origin 7,300 years \\nago in West Africa (see the Note Added in Proof at the end of this article).\\nThese high population frequencies mean that a significant proportion of babies born \\nwithin these geographic areas are affected by SCA. Furthermore, recent global population \\nmigration means that SCD is now a major contributor to health problems in many regions \\nthat are well beyond its early geographic origins (154), including the Caribbean islands, \\nBrazil, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and cosmopolitan parts of other \\nEuropean countries (154). Recent estimates suggest that globally, more than 300,000 \\nchildren are born with SCA every year (88, 153).\\nIn addition to HbS, malaria has led to positive selection for a wide range of other genetic \\nconditions in the same geographic areas. Like HbS, the best described of these conditions \\nalso relate to erythrocytes, including other structural hemoglobin variants, the thalassemias, \\nerythrocyte enzymopathies (most notably glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), \\nand polymorphisms in erythrocyte surface molecules, including the Duffy antigen receptor \\nfor chemokines (DARC), complement receptors, and ABO blood groups (216). As a result, \\nmany patients with SCA also inherit other genetic variants, some of which may affect their \\nclinical phenotype, the relevance of which we discuss in further detail below (see the section \\ntitled Factors Determining Outcome).\\nDiagnosis\\nPreconception, antenatal, and neonatal screening programs are important in the clinical \\ncare and public health management of SCA. The most common approaches to diagnosis \\nin high-income countries include gel-based or capillary electrophoresis, high-performance \\nliquid chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. All are sensitive in identifying affected \\nindividuals but are limited by their inability to reliably distinguish HbSS from HbS/β0-\\nthalassemia. However, most neonatal screening programs involve testing during the first \\nWilliams and Thein Page 3\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet.

This has prompted the development of \\nnew approaches that include tandem mass spectrometry (126), DNA diagnostics (including \\nTaqman PCR and sequence analysis of specifically amplified HBB genes) (192), and \\nnext-generation sequencing analysis (163, 176). Although these increasingly sophisticated \\nmethods are now entering clinical practice in high-income countries, few are readily \\navailable to the majority of patients in low-income regions. For many years, the mainstay \\nof diagnosis in these regions has been the sodium metabisulfite sickling test or commercial \\nvariations of it (94); however, these tests cannot reliably distinguish carriers from affected \\npatients. Several alternative, point-of-care approaches are currently under development, of \\nwhich the most advanced—an antibody-based lateral-flow assay marketed under the name of \\nSickle SCAN—is now commercially available (105).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe fundamental event that underlies the manifold pathophysiological consequences of \\nSCA is the polymerization of HbS under conditions of low oxygen tension (35). HbS \\npolymerization alters both the structure and function of erythrocytes, initiating a cascade \\nof events that ultimately affect a wide range of tissues, with far-reaching clinical and \\npathological consequences. Our understanding of these processes has been accelerated more \\nrecently through newer techniques, of which the use of murine models has been particularly \\ninfluential (225). The most important of these processes are summarized in Figure 3 and \\ndescribed in further detail below.\\nVasoocclusion\\nThe polymerization of HbS activates calcium-influx-mediated dehydration, increasing \\nthe concentration of intracellular hemoglobin, further exacerbating polymerization, and \\nultimately resulting in irreversibly distorted and bizarrely shaped erythrocytes (181). Sickled \\nerythrocytes have difficulty negotiating the microvasculature and cause logjams that result \\nin local tissue hypoxemia. The recent development of microfluidic devices provides a \\ngraphic in vitro illustration of how this simple mechanical process might lead to tissue \\nischemia in vivo (62). Nevertheless, it would be overly simplistic to attribute the tissue \\ninjury that accompanies SCA to mechanical obstruction alone. The sickled erythrocytes \\nare also highly fragile (life span of 16 days compared with 120 for normal red blood \\ncells) (90), and the continual release of cell-free hemoglobin from hemolysis depletes the \\nbioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), contributing to pathology. Neutrophilia is an additional \\nfeature of SCA that has been consistently correlated with disease severity (38, 107, 141, 156, \\n225), and more recent studies have shown that even at steady state, these neutrophils are \\nhighly activated (109, 225). The detrimental effect of neutrophils in sickle pathophysiology \\nis supported by case reports of severe and fatal acute events triggered by drug-induced \\nneutrophil production (1, 6, 86, 208). Recent studies indicate that neutrophils play a central \\nrole in vasoocclusion through their interactions with both erythrocytes and endothelium. \\nImportant elements include the activation of endothelial cells to upregulate the expression \\nof cytoadhesion molecules such as the P- and E-selectins, intercellular adhesion molecule \\n1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Endogenous factors of \\nWilliams and Thein Page 4\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptstissue activation include the release of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes (including \\nTNF-α, IL-6, IL1-β, and IL-3), while exogenous factors include microbial antigens (95). \\nObservations made in mice have shown that sickled erythrocytes bind to neutrophils \\nthat are themselves bound to inflamed cremasteric venules, resulting in vasoocclusion \\n(194). Moreover, the finding that mice deficient in P- and E-selectin are protected from \\nvasoocclusion has provided impetus for the development of treatments designed to block this \\ninteraction (194). In support of this idea, neutrophils from HbSS individuals show greater \\nlevels of obstruction compared with those from HbAA individuals in E-selectin/ICAM-1-\\ncoated microchannels (58). HbSS erythrocytes alone were nonadherent but required mixed \\nsuspensions of erythrocytes and neutrophils to elicit vasoocclusion (58). A recent study \\nshowed that neutrophils from SCA individuals can also form neutrophil extracellular traps \\nthat inflict further damage on the endothelium (45).\\nIn addition to neutrophils and monocytes, platelets are activated in steady-state patients with \\nSCA, and activation increases further during vasoocclusive crises (101, 206, 225). Platelets \\nform aggregates with erythrocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils both in patients and in \\nmurine models (57, 75, 221, 225). Moreover, as with neutrophils, it appears that this process \\nis dependent on P-selectin (159, 161). SCA has long been considered a hypercoagulable \\nstate, as illustrated by the increased rates of venous and arterial thrombotic events. Not only \\nis the incidence of venous thrombotic events increased (particularly pulmonary embolism), \\nbut these events also occur in younger patients and are significantly associated with elevated \\nsteady-state platelet counts (34, 198). This has prompted clinical trials on antiplatelet \\nagents for the prevention of acute vasoocclusive pain (below), and the hospital management \\nof acute pain crises in many centers now includes prophylactic anticoagulation. Because \\npatients who have suffered one venous thrombotic event are more likely to have additional \\nevents, it has been proposed that such patients should be placed on lifelong anticoagulation.\\nHemolysis\\nPatients with SCA are in a constant state of uncompensated hemolysis, which further \\nincreases during painful crises, as reflected by further elevated levels of plasma lactate \\ndehydrogenase (16, 77). While steady-state hemolysis involves both an intravascular and \\nan extravascular component (23), the intravascular element has been the main focus \\nfrom a pathophysiological perspective. It has been proposed that the release of both free \\nhemoglobin and arginase is directly responsible for a chain of events that results in \\nvascular pathology. Important elements include the depletion of bioavailable NO via a \\ndioxygenation reaction (165), the depletion of arginine (a substrate for NO production), and \\nthe promotion of oxidant stress and endothelial inflammation through exposure to free heme \\nand heme-laden microparticles (36). Exposure of endothelium to heme in mice leads to \\nupregulation in the production of various adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, P-selectin, \\nand fibronectin; the recruitment of neutrophils; and increased vascular permeability (207). \\nSuch observations have led to the hypothesis that excessive heme might play a role in \\nexacerbating the vasoocclusive process. Free heme also leads to the activation of neutrophils \\nand the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which damage the vasculature (45). As a \\nresult of such observations, it has been postulated that variation in the degree of hemolysis \\namong individual patients may contribute to the variable phenotypes of SCA (106).\\nWilliams and Thein Page 5\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsClinical Course and Complications\\nThe clinical course of SCA is notoriously variable. Progressive damage to a range of organs \\nis a constant feature of the disease; however, the factors that determine the degree to which \\nspecific organs are involved remain incompletely understood. Historically, the most widely \\nrecognized complications of SCA were the acute clinical events that punctuate periods \\nof reasonable health, of which pain is the most common. However, with increasing life \\nexpectancy, many complications that result from damage to a range of end organs are now \\nbeing described. The most common complications of SCA are summarized in Table 1 and \\nFigure 4 and discussed in further detail below.\\nAcute Manifestations of Sickle Cell Anemia\\nOne of the most common early manifestations of SCA is the hand–foot syndrome, which \\nis characterized by the painful swelling of one or more extremities owing to the infarction \\nof marrow within the small bones of the hands and feet (223). Beyond the first year \\nof life, the most frequent acute complication is a painful crisis. Such episodes most \\ncommonly occur in the extremities, chest, abdomen, and back and result from vasoocclusive \\nepisodes with ischemia–reperfusion injury (67). At times, painful crises can be complicated \\nby bony necrosis with secondary infections, including osteomyelitis and septic arthritis. \\nRare in the first six months of life (because fetal hemoglobin levels are still elevated), \\npainful crises become increasingly frequent thereafter, reaching an overall incidence of \\napproximately 40 per 100 person-years of observation (PYO) beyond the second year of life \\n(80). Painful crises frequently require treatment with strong analgesics, including opioids, \\nwith the attendant risk of the development of opioid dependency. Another common acute \\ncomplication of SCA is acute chest syndrome (ACS). ACS presents with a clinical picture \\n(including cough, shortness of breath, and signs of consolidation and hypoxemia) that \\nis difficult to distinguish from acute pneumonia (223). Episodes can present in apparent \\nisolation or complicate painful crises or surgical procedures, particularly those involving the \\nabdomen (202, 203). Common etiological factors include acute infections, bone marrow fat \\nembolism, and microembolism of aggregated blood cells (132, 223). The incidence of ACS \\nis lower in older adults than in children (38, 203), but both severity and mortality are higher \\nin adults, largely because of a higher incidence of bone marrow and fat emboli in adults \\n(202) and the frequent presence of comorbidities.\\nAcute anemia, usually defined as a decline in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more from \\nsteady-state levels (223), is a common feature of painful crises but can also result from \\nsequestration of erythrocytes in deep vascular beds, most commonly within the spleen \\n(acute splenic sequestration) or liver (acute hepatic sequestration) (27, 89); aplastic episodes \\nsecondary to parvovirus B19 infection (174); or increased hemolysis secondary to serious \\nacute infections or delayed transfusion reactions. Patients with SCA are also at substantial \\nrisk of serious acute bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Streptococcus \\npneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and non-Typhi Salmonella species. Progressive \\ninvolution of the spleen leads to functional asplenia from early childhood, vasoocclusive \\nepisodes can violate the integrity of gut and other barrier tissues to result in the translocation \\nof pathogens, and ischemic tissue in various organ systems can provide a niche for septic \\nWilliams and Thein Page 6\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsfoci (31). In the preprophylaxis era, the incidence of invasive bacterial sepsis was as high as \\n10 per 100 PYO in the first 5 years of life (80).\\nThree further common acute complications are priapism, acute kidney injury, and stroke. \\nPriapism, an unwanted and painful erection of the penis that lasts for more than 2 h, is \\nfrequently recurrent and occurs with a lifetime prevalence of 20–89% in boys and men (5, \\n114, 143). Acute kidney injury is an underrecognized acute event that in one prospective \\ncase series complicated 8% of all admissions with ACS in children (110). Finally, stroke \\nis probably the most serious and devastating acute complication of SCA, occurring at an \\noverall rate of 0.61 episodes per 100 PYO before the development of specific interventions \\n(141). Strokes can be either infarctive or hemorrhagic, the former being the more common \\n(141). During childhood, the risk of infarctive stroke can be predicted from blood velocities \\nin the cerebral vessels measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography (2). As a \\nresult, TCD is now widely deployed for screening, and those with increased velocities (≥200 \\ncm/s) are deemed at high risk of developing a stroke and targeted for preventive transfusion \\ntherapy (see the section titled The Management and Outcome of Sickle Cell Anemia in \\nHigh-Income Countries).\\nChronic Complications of Sickle Cell Anemia\\nWith increasing survival, cumulative complications of SCA are becoming increasingly \\napparent in adults in high-income countries. It is now clear that subtle neurological \\ndeterioration is more common than previously realized (54). Neuroimaging studies, most \\nrecently using near-magnetic resonance imaging, have shown that silent cerebral infarcts \\n(signal abnormalities of at least 3 mm in the presence of a normal neurological examination) \\nare common, affecting 39% of patients by the age of 18 years in one such study (24). \\nRisk factors include lower hemoglobin concentrations and higher systolic blood pressures, \\nmale sex, and acute anemic events (25, 55). Chronic heart and lung complications are \\nalso common, particularly in older children and adults. Clinical manifestations include \\nimpaired pulmonary function and exercise tolerance and progressive heart failure (85). \\nPulmonary hypertension, defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of ≥25 mm Hg at \\nrest as determined by right heart catheterization, is the most common chronic pulmonary \\ncomplication of SCA and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. \\nThree studies utilizing right heart catheterization estimated the prevalence of pulmonary \\nhypertension in adults at 6.0–10.4% (74, 121, 147). In studies conducted in France and \\nBrazil, pulmonary hypertension was associated with three-year mortality rates of 12.5% \\nand 37.5%, respectively (74, 147), while a six-year mortality of 37% was reported in a \\nstudy conducted in the United States (121). Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity has been used \\nas a noninvasive alternative to right heart catheterization in the prediction of pulmonary \\nhypertension in multiple studies. Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity values of ≥2.5 m/s, as \\nmeasured by two-dimensional echocardiography, are suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, \\nand values of ≥3 m/s are strongly predictive (74, 147). Approximately half of pulmonary \\nhypertension cases are precapillary and result from a vasculopathy caused by recurrent \\nsickling, inflammation, chronic thromboembolism, and hemolysis-induced NO depletion, as \\ndiscussed above (85). The rest have postcapillary disease from left ventricular dysfunction \\nWilliams and Thein Page 7\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptscaused by elevated cardiac output and left ventricular volume overload secondary to chronic \\nanemia (131).\\nThe hypoxia, acidosis, and hyperosmolarity within the inner medulla of the renal cortex \\ncreate a perfect environment for the polymerization of HbS. Over time, repeated cycles \\nof acute kidney injury lead to the chronic microvascular disease of established sickle \\ncell nephropathy. Renal complications are manifest from early life (213) and include \\nhyperfiltration, hyposthenuria (diminished concentrating ability), and albuminuria. In \\nchildhood, sickle cell nephropathy can manifest as polyuria, nocturia, and nocturnal \\nenuresis. The prevalence of albuminuria increases with age, and in one study 60% of \\npatients with SCA had microalbuminuria by age 55 (50). Advanced chronic kidney disease \\n(stage III–IV , defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15–60 mL/min per 1.73 \\nm2) occurs in 4–18% of adults with SCA (173). Increasing renal dysfunction can also \\nresult in arterial hypertension. Table 1 summarizes additional common acute and chronic \\ncomplications of SCA.\\nFactors Determining Outcome\\nBoth environmental and genetic factors contribute to the clinical variability of SCA. \\nAlthough the importance of weather as a trigger of acute pain has been suspected for \\nmany years, it has been difficult to prove for logistic reasons (155). Twin studies suggest \\nthat environmental factors in general are important determinants of the clinical course of \\nSCA. Such studies include two case reports limited to single pairs, one with HbSS and \\nα-thalassemia and the other with HbS and β-thalassemia (8, 103), and nine pairs of identical \\ntwins from Jamaica, six with HbSS and three with HbSC (214). These studies show that, \\nwhile twins may have similar laboratory parameters and attain similar heights and weights, \\nthere is considerable discordance in the frequency of painful crises and other complications. \\nFurthermore, other environmental factors, including nutritional status and access to social \\nsupport and medical care, influence risk factors such as infections (155).\\nFactors that influence the primary event of HbS polymerization (including coexisting \\nα-thalassemia and HbF concentrations) have a global effect on the disease phenotype. \\nApproximately one-third of SCA patients of African descent also have α-thalassemia, \\nusually caused by the common African 3.7-kb (−α3.7) deletional variant (200). While the \\nmajority are heterozygous (αα/−α3.7), 3–5% are homozygous (−α3.7/−α3.7). Coexisting \\nα-thalassemia results in reduced intracellular HbS and mean corpuscular hemoglobin \\nconcentrations, reductions in the frequency of HbS polymerization and number of \\nirreversibly sickled cells, and an increased hematocrit (68, 180). While some of these \\neffects are beneficial, others are detrimental. Patients with SCA and α-thalassemia have a \\nreduced risk of hemolytic complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, \\nnephropathy, priapism, and leg ulcers, but an increased risk of vasoocclusive complications, \\nsuch as ACS, painful crises, osteonecrosis, and retinopathy (179). Several studies have \\nalso demonstrated an association with lower TCD velocities and stroke (26, 49, 71). The \\nreduced hemolysis reduces bilirubin, with a quantitative effect that is independent of that \\nof the UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism (200). However, coinheritance of α-thalassemia \\nWilliams and Thein Page 8\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsblunts the response to hydroxyurea therapy, potentially because it affects the HbF and mean \\ncorpuscular volume responses (199).\\nHbF has a sparing effect on HbS polymerization because the hybrid tetramers (α2γβS) \\nand HbF (α2γ2) have a diluting effect on the intracellular HbS (α2βS2) concentration. In \\naddition, α2γβS tetramers cannot partake in HbS polymerization. Even a small decrease in \\nHbS concentration can increase the delay time to polymerization and allow more cells to \\nescape sickling (129, 158). As a result, HbF has a globally beneficial effect on SCA: High \\nlevels are associated with reduced pain and improved survival (156), while low levels are \\nassociated with an increased risk of brain infarcts in young children (209). Genome-wide \\nassociation studies of HbF and its associated trait, erythrocytes containing HbF (or F cells), \\nhave shown that genetic variants at three quantitative trait loci—BCL11A on chromosome \\n2p, HMIP-2 on chromosome 6q, and Xmn1-HBG2 (rs7482144) on chromosome 11p—\\ntogether account for up to half of the common variation in the Caucasian non-SCA \\npopulation (191) and between 8% and ~20% of the variability in HbF concentrations among \\npatients with SCA (112, 113, 117, 219). Downstream studies in primary human erythroid \\nprogenitor cells and transgenic mice have demonstrated that BCL11A acts as a repressor \\nof γ-globin gene expression (169, 222). High-resolution mapping, further validated by \\nsystematic dissection using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing approach, has confirmed that \\nthese variants are localized to enhancers in intron 2 of the gene that are erythroid specific \\n(18).\\nWith regard to HMIP-2 on chromosome 6q, subsequent studies showed that the intergenic \\nregion contains two clusters of HbF-affecting variants that occupy critical core enhancer \\nelements that regulate MYB, which encodes the MYB transcription factor essential for \\nhematopoiesis and erythroid differentiation (177). As a result, it has been proposed that \\nMYB modulates HbF expression by two potential mechanisms: (a) indirectly, by altering the \\nkinetics of erythroid differentiation (low MYB levels accelerate erythroid differentiation \\nand lead to the release of early erythroid progenitor cells that are still synthesizing \\npredominantly HbF) (102, 178), and (b) directly, via activation of KLF1 and other repressors \\nof γ-globin genes (29, 184). Rare variants in KLF1 have also been associated with HbF \\nlevels in various erythrocyte disorders, including SCA (151). However, several genome-wide \\nassociation studies of HbF have failed to identify common KLF1 variants (28, 130). In \\nAfrican American patients and patients from Cameroon, an association between HbF and \\nthree loci (BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB, and XmnI-HBG2) also correlated with reductions in the \\nrates of acute vasoocclusive pain and hospitalization (113, 219), while the presence of HbF-\\npromoting variants in BCL11A was associated with a reduced rate of SCA complications, \\nparticularly with stroke in a Brazilian cohort (112).\\nCoexisting α-thalassemia and HbF concentrations alone are not sufficient to explain the \\nobserved diversity in the severity of SCA between individual patients. Both candidate gene \\nand genome-wide association studies have been used to search for other modifying genetic \\nvariants. Many of these studies have focused on specific complications of SCA (such as \\nstroke, proteinuria, osteonecrosis, or pulmonary hypertension) as separate phenotypic end \\npoints; however, given the complexity of the factors that lead to such outcomes, it is not \\nsurprising that studies that have employed more simple intermediate phenotypes that are \\nWilliams and Thein Page 9\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptsreproducible, measurable, and disease related (like HbF and bilirubin levels) have been \\nmore successful. Based on an understanding of SCA pathophysiology, candidate genes \\nthat could plausibly influence different SCA-related complications have been selected \\nand single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through association studies. The \\ncomplications studied included acute painful episodes, bilirubin levels, and predisposition \\nto gallstones, stroke, priapism, osteonecrosis (or avascular necrosis), leg ulcers, pulmonary \\ndisease (pulmonary hypertension and ACS), bacteremia and other infections, and renal \\ndisease. Table 2 summarizes the genetic variants that have been associated with these major \\nSCA-related complications.\\nRates of acute pain can vary widely among patients, but the highest rates are in patients with \\nhigh hematocrits and low HbF concentrations (17). Besides HbF levels and a possible role \\nof α-thalassemia, very little is known about the genetic basis for the variability of painful \\ncrises. Case–control studies are problematic because it is difficult to objectively quantitate \\nboth the frequency and severity of painful episodes within or among patients. The response \\nto opioid analgesia varies considerably among individuals, and the efficacy of these drugs \\nmay itself be related to genetic variability in their metabolism (17). An association between \\nserum bilirubin levels or gallstones and a promoter polymorphism in UGT1A1 has been \\nconsistently demonstrated in SCA individuals of all ages and different population groups \\nusing both candidate gene and genome-wide approaches (42, 70, 124, 200). The influence of \\npolymorphisms in UGT1A1 became more evident in patients while on hydroxyurea therapy: \\nChildren with the 6/6 UGT1A1 genotype achieved normal bilirubin levels, while children \\nwith 6/7 or 7/7 UGT1A1 genotypes did not (92). Co-occurrence of α-thalassemia also has \\na quantitative effect on serum bilirubin levels in patients with SCA (200). The triad of the \\nUGT1A1 genotype, SCA, and gallstones presents a possible clinical context where genetic \\ninformation might aid clinical decision-making with regard to elective cholecystectomy.\\nA familial predisposition to stroke was first suggested by an increased incidence among \\nsiblings with SCA (61), prompting numerous genetic studies. In some, stroke was \\nsubdivided into large- and small-vessel disease based on imaging studies (97). Of the 38 \\npublished SNPs that have been associated with stroke, the effects of α-thalassemia and SNPs \\nin four genes (ADYC9, ANXA2, TEK, and TGFBR3) have been most replicable, albeit \\nat marginal levels of significance (71). Genomewide association studies and whole-exome \\nsequencing studies have recently identified additional protective associations in pediatric \\npatients at two genes (GOLGB1 and ENPP1), but, again, this warrants further validation \\n(72).\\nIndependent studies have identified associations between mutations in KLOTHO (KL) and \\npriapism in different populations (66, 139). Separately, the TGF-β/SMAD pathway has also \\nbeen implicated in priapism risk (66). Higher hematocrits are a predisposing factor for \\nosteonecrosis, and hence an increased incidence has been seen in patients with coexisting \\nα-thalassemia. Studies suggesting that factors in the coagulation pathway, such as MTHFR \\nand platelet adhesion (HPA-5B allele), may also be involved have been inconclusive (9, 15, \\n39, 108, 196).\\nWilliams and Thein Page 10\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet.

It affects up to 70% of Jamaican patients, but reported rates \\nhave been much lower (30–40%) in other patient cohorts (7). This complication is closely \\nassociated with the severity of hemolysis, which potentially explains the protective effect \\nof co-occurring α-thalassemia. Candidate gene association studies have implicated several \\ngenes in the TGF-β/SMAD/BMP pathway (138). Polymorphisms in DARC have also been \\nassociated with the persistence of leg ulcers, and it has been suggested that the relatively \\nhigher white cell and neutrophil counts potentiate inflammation in the Duffy-positive \\npatients (60).\\nPulmonary hypertension, defined by a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity of ≥2.5 m/s, occurs \\nin approximately 30% of adults with SCA and is an important risk factor for premature \\ndeath (81). Multiple gene associations have been identified, including polymorphisms \\nin the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway (ACVRL1, BMPR2, and BMP6) (10) and others \\npreviously implicated in primary idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (116). A more recent \\nmulticenter study (226) considered the hypoxic response to be contributory to pulmonary \\nhypertension. A SNP (rs10857560) associated with reduced expression of MAPK8, which \\nencodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase important for apoptosis, T cell differentiation, \\nand inflammatory responses, correlated with pulmonary hypertension.\\nA gene-centric association study of ACS using individuals from the US Cooperative Study \\nof Sickle Cell Disease found an association with rs6141803. This SNP is located 8.2 kb \\nupstream of COMMD7, a gene highly expressed in the lung that interacts with NF-κB \\nsignaling (76). Another candidate gene is heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), which produces the \\nprotein HO-1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme, which might attenuate \\nthe severity of acute pain and hemolysis. Bean et al. (19) investigated a highly polymorphic \\n(GT)n dinucleotide repeat in the HMOX1 promoter and showed that children with two \\nshorter alleles had lower rates of ACS.\\nStudies have suggested that the incidence of bacterial infections among patients with SCA \\nmight be modulated by polymorphisms in MBL2 at the HLA locus, MPO (encoding \\nmyeloperoxidase), DARC, and the TGF-β/BMP pathway (4, 48, 136, 185).\\nRenal dysfunction, as measured by proteinuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate, \\ncorrelates with the severity of hemolysis (50). Hence, it is also not surprising that co-\\noccurrence of α-thalassemia is protective against albuminuria (50, 135). The MYH9-APOL1 \\nlocus, an important genetic risk factor for end-stage renal failure in non-SCA populations \\nof African ancestry (79), is also associated with nephropathy in patients with SCA (11, \\n78, 170). The true association is broadly considered to be with APOL1, owing both to \\nthe stronger statistical association with that gene and to the lack of identification of causal \\nfunctional variants in MYH9. The original association with MYH9 has been attributed to the \\nstrong linkage disequilibrium between MYH9 and APOL1.\\nIt must be said that, in general, the lack of replication in independent studies means that \\nmany of the published genetic associations remain somewhat questionable.

Of the published genetic associations, beyond α-thalassemia and those specific \\nto HbF, only two are strongly convincing: the association between UGT1A1 and bilirubin \\nlevels and predisposition to gallstones and the association between the MYH9-APOL1 locus \\nand sickle nephropathy, which are compelling because they have been replicated in different \\nSCA cohorts and confirmed in populations without SCA.\\nThe Management and Outcome of Sickle Cell Anemia In High-Income \\nCountries\\nA major evidence-based review of the management of SCA was recently undertaken by \\nthe US National Institutes of Health and published in 2014 (132, 223). A striking feature \\nof that report was that many recommendations are based on levels of evidence that are \\nless than high, reflecting the widespread paucity of data from randomized controlled trials. \\nFor many years, the cornerstones of treatment for the majority of patients affected by \\nSCA have been the prevention of bacterial infections and the management of complications \\nsuch as pain and end-organ damage. As stated above, without specific interventions, the \\nincidence of severe and fatal bacterial infections is extremely high, particularly in the early \\nyears of life (31). However, early mortality from severe bacterial infections has now been \\nall but eliminated by the widespread implementation of prophylaxis with penicillin during \\nthe 1970s and 1980s and by the subsequent introduction of specific vaccines for both S. \\npneumoniae and H. influenzae. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that these interventions \\ndo not completely eliminate the risk and that the incidence of invasive infections with \\nS. pneumoniae, particularly those caused by strains that are not covered by the standard \\npneumococcal vaccines, remains unacceptably high (119, 134). Although rates of invasive \\npneumonococcal disease fell by 65% in US children with SCD following the introduction \\nof the PCV7 vaccine (120), a recent study from Minnesota reported an incidence that is \\nstill 18 times that reported among children without SCA in the postvaccine era (119). \\nSuch studies bring into question the practice of discontinuing penicillin at 5 years of age, \\nparticularly given the low level of evidence on which this practice is based (69, 132, 223). \\nParvovirus B19 infection, the cause of a mild flu-like illness (the so-called fifth disease) \\nin children without SCA, can have serious consequences in patients with SCA. The most \\ncommon manifestation is a transient but potentially fatal erythrocyte aplasia that can lead \\nto acute severe anemia (174), but infections can also contribute to the development of ACS \\nand nephrotic syndrome (162). As a consequence, for some years there has been interest \\nin the development of a parvovirus B19 vaccine for use in children with SCA. A leading \\ncandidate currently in preclinical development, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae–derived virus-\\nlike particle-based vaccine, was immunogenic in both wild-type mice (43) and a mouse \\nmodel for SCA (150).\\nEstablished Treatments for Sickle Cell Anemia\\nFor many years, specific treatments for the majority of patients with SCA have been limited \\nto the provision of analgesics during painful crises and blood transfusions for particular \\nindications, including episodes of ACS or severe acute anemia (132, 223). Two additional \\nWilliams and Thein Page 12\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptstreatments—long-term transfusion therapy with iron chelation and hydroxyurea—have been \\nreserved largely for patients with specific complications. However, informed by the growing \\nappreciation of the pathophysiological processes that underlie the complications of SCA, an \\nincreasing number of newer drugs and treatments are now being developed, some of which \\ncould potentially prevent or reverse the course of SCA.\\nHydroxyurea\\nUntil very recently, hydroxyurea was the only disease-modifying drug ever to be licensed \\nfor the treatment of SCA by the US Food and Drug Administration. Hydroxyurea was \\noriginally used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the management of malignancies, but its \\npotential benefits as a treatment for SCA were first recognized more than 30 years ago \\n(157). Hydroxyurea is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in DNA \\nsynthesis (65), and this appears to be key to its numerous therapeutic effects. Hydroxyurea \\nhas many of the attributes of an ideal drug for SCA because it has multiple mechanisms \\nof action that affect various points on the pathophysiological pathway described above. \\nWhen administered once daily at the correct dose (typically 15–30 mg/kg, as determined \\nby titration against hematological response indices), hydroxyurea leads to therapeutic \\nreductions in neutrophils, reticulocytes, platelet counts, and inflammatory cytokines, all \\nof which have been implicated in the process of vasoocclusion. Finally, hydroxyurea \\ncommonly (but not universally) results in the therapeutic induction of HbF, the beneficial \\neffects of which were discussed in detail above. Together, these mechanisms lead to lower \\nlevels of hemolysis (a process implicated in endovascular injury), a consequent increase in \\nsteady-state hemoglobin, and improved rheology of erythrocytes and neutrophils through \\nreduced vascular cytoadherence (210). Nevertheless, although these protean benefits of \\nhydroxyurea have been documented through multiple clinical trials conducted in both adults \\nand children, its introduction into routine treatment has been surprisingly slow, and uptake in \\nsome countries (including well-resourced ones) remains relatively low.\\nChronic Transfusion Therapy\\nChronic transfusion therapy has long been shown to reduce the risk of strokes in children \\nwho are at increased risk on the basis of TCD monitoring (3). In the Stroke Prevention \\nTrial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP), transfusion therapy was associated with a 92% \\nreduction in the risk of overt stroke among children with TCD velocities of ≥200 cm/s \\nand also reduced the risk of further strokes in children with existing silent infarcts (53). \\nHowever, the discontinuation of transfusion therapy is associated with a high rate of \\nreversion to abnormal TCD velocities and a high risk of further strokes (111, 144). The \\nStroke with Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) trial showed that continued \\ntransfusions with chelation therapy were superior to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy in the \\nmanagement of children with an existing stroke and iron overload (212), but the recently \\ncompleted Transcranial Doppler with Transfusions Changing to Hydroxyurea (TWiTCH) \\ntrial asked whether hydroxyurea could be used as an alternative approach to primary stroke \\nprevention in high-risk children. Because it is currently the standard of care, all children \\nwere first established on transfusion therapy; however, TWiTCH showed that, in children \\nwho have been transfused for at least one year, switching to hydroxyurea was as effective as \\ncontinuing transfusions in terms of TCD velocities (211).\\nWilliams and Thein Page 13\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsBlood transfusion remains an essential element in the management of patients with SCA, \\nand indications for blood transfusion are expanding (59), but it is not without risk. Common \\ncomplications include secondary iron overload and hemolytic transfusion reactions caused \\nby the development of red blood cell antigen alloimmunization, and transmission of \\ninfections remains a significant issue in many countries (46). The most feared complication \\nis alloimmunization to red blood cell antigens, which is relatively more common in patients \\nwith SCA and can lead to difficulties in sourcing appropriately matched blood products, \\ndelayed transfusion reactions, significant morbidities, and even fatalities in some cases (52, \\n204). Clinician awareness of delayed transfusion reactions is poor because symptoms mimic \\nacute vasoocclusive pain and immunohematology findings are often negative. One possible \\nreason for the relatively high incidence of alloimmunization observed in the SCA population \\nis the mismatch in the red blood cell antigens expressed in patients of African descent and \\ndonors of primarily northern European descent (224). However, despite ethnic matching, a \\nsignificant proportion of SCApatients still became alloimmunized (47). Molecular analyses \\nof the RH genes in SCA patients and African American donors revealed remarkable RH \\nallelic diversity in this population and mismatch between serologic Rh phenotype and RHD \\nor RHCE genotype owing to variant RH alleles in 87% of individuals (47). As a prevention, \\nmany blood transfusion centers have adopted extended red cell phenotyping, including \\nABO, Rh, Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and S and s antigens, and some centers have also adopted \\nmolecular genotyping for red blood cell phenotype prediction using microarray chips (e.g., \\nthe PreciseType HEA BeadChip assay).\\nNew Treatments for Sickle Cell Anemia\\nAs stated above, until very recently, the management of SCA was largely reactive. \\nComplications, particularly painful crises, have been managed as they occur, and preventive \\ntreatments have been limited largely to hydroxyurea and blood transfusion. In the last two \\ndecades, however, the situation has changed dramatically with the development of new drugs \\nand treatments for specific types of crisis and of other drugs that are aimed at preventing \\nor reversing the development of complications altogether. To some extent, this reflects the \\ngrowing realization that even in patients with a seemingly mild phenotype, ongoing chronic \\nhemolytic anemia is a pathological driver of insidious end-organ damage. The recent surge \\nin new drugs has also been helped by the designation of SCA as an orphan disease (a disease \\nthat affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States), with the result that drugs that \\nare developed for its treatment benefit from the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which allows \\nfor significant financial incentives. The most significant new drugs for the prevention and \\ntreatment of SCA are summarized in Table 3 and discussed in further detail below.\\nThe Prevention of Polymerization\\nAs discussed above, the polymerization of deoxy-HbS is the root cause of the downstream \\nconsequences of SCA. The development of a drug that prevents or mitigates this \\npolymerization could therefore be transformative. Several approaches have been considered, \\nas summarized in a recent comprehensive review (64). The best established is the induction \\nof HbF synthesis, which holds particular promise because there is plentiful evidence \\nof efficacy from clinical and epidemiological studies. As discussed above, the onset of \\nWilliams and Thein Page 14\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptssymptoms among children with SCA is delayed for several months, until HbF is replaced \\nby HbS. Moreover, the proportion of HbF beyond that point is one of few factors that \\ncorrelates closely with outcome. Finally, it is believed that the induction of HbF is a \\nmajor element in the effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy. Alternative approaches to HbF \\ninduction are under investigation, and several drugs have entered clinical trials. Advances \\nin our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating the switch from fetal to adult \\nglobin-gene expression have led to the generation of new agents that fall into two main \\ngroups: those that affect chromatin regulators (such as decitabine on DNA methylation \\nand histone deacetylase inhibitors) and those that affect DNA-binding transcription factors. \\nBCL11A is a potent repressor of HbF but has important roles in neuronal development \\nand B cell function. Lineage-specific, microRNA-mediated short hairpin RNA suppression \\nof BCL11A in erythroid cells led to stable long-term engraftment of gene-modified cells \\nand increases in HbF (33). Dissection of the BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer down \\nto a small region in intron 2 of the gene offers the possibility of disrupting this region \\nand specifically targeting erythroid function using genome-editing technology such as zinc-\\nfinger nucleases or CRISPR/Cas9 (37, 205). It might also be possible to derepress γ-globin \\nexpression by forcing interaction of the β-locus control region with the γ-globin gene using \\na synthetic DNA-binding protein (32, 56). This forced chromosomal looping approach has \\nthe advantage that βS-globin expression is reduced concomitantly with increased γ-globin \\nexpression.\\nIn addition to agents aimed at inducing HbF production, drugs designed to inhibit \\npolymerization directly are under development. In theory, it should be possible to prevent \\npolymerization through the use of small molecules designed to block the sites at which \\nthe α- and βS-globin chains bind during this process, and although no candidates have yet \\nbeen identified, this approach remains the target of active research (64). 5-Hydroxymethyl-\\nfurfural (Aes-103) is a naturally occurring aldehyde that binds to the N-terminal valine \\nresidue of the α-globin chain of HbS and results in a dose-dependent increase in its oxygen \\naffinity (140). Effective at preventing polymerization in vitro, Aes-103 was well tolerated \\nand apparently safe in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial conducted in adults (140). Although \\nthe final analysis is not yet complete, early results from a phase 2 trial (NCT01987908) \\nshow no obvious benefit of Aes-103 over placebo, and as a result, the trial was terminated \\nearly. However, the study was designed to address dose and safety as opposed to efficacy, \\nwith three-quarters of participants randomized to the active drug; further trials will therefore \\nbe needed to determine its utility. A second drug has since been developed that acts through \\nthe same mechanism but with higher specificity and at lower concentrations (123, 142). \\nGBT440 is a polyaromatic aldehyde that was safe in early phase trials and was associated \\nwith a dose-dependent increase in hemoglobin, decreased reticulocytes, irreversibly sickled \\ncell counts, and serum bilirubin concentrations, consistent with reduced levels of early \\nhemolysis. Multicenter phase 3 clinical studies of GBT440 are now being launched in both \\nadults (NCT03036813) and children (NCT02850406), the results of which are awaited with \\nconsiderable interest.\\nWhile two further approaches to the prevention of sickling showed early promise, neither \\nproved effective in clinical trials. The kinetics of HbS polymerization are exquisitely \\nsensitive to HbS concentration, and in theory, reducing the intracellular concentration of \\nWilliams and Thein Page 15\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsHbS by as little as 10% could be beneficial. Senicapoc (ICA-17043) counters the potassium \\nleak and dehydration that are characteristic of the cellular pathology of SCA by targeting \\nthe Gardos channel. While early results were promising in terms of markers of reduced \\nhemolysis and improved erythrocyte survival (14), a phase 3 trial proved negative in terms \\nof efficacy in the prevention of vasoocclusive crises (13). Finally, Sanguinate, a bovine \\nPEGylated hemoglobin product, was designed to block the polymerization of HbS through \\nthe delivery of carbon monoxide, a potent antisickling agent. Sanguinate is administered \\nintravenously, and its potential benefits are limited to the treatment of vasoocclusive events. \\nA phase 1 trial found sufficient evidence of safety (125) to allow its progression to a phase 2 \\ntrial (NCT02411708).\\nPreventing and Reversing Vasoocclusion\\nSeveral drugs that have been designed to target the general area of vasoocclusion are in \\nvarious stages of development, some of which have shown considerable promise in clinical \\ntrials. The recently described involvement of endothelial adhesion molecules has led to \\nthe development of several specific inhibitors, with a particular focus on the selectins. \\nCrizanlizumab, an intravenously administered monoclonal antibody that targets P-selectin, \\nhas shown efficacy in both the prevention and reversal of the sequestration process in in \\nvitro models, and results from early trials in humans have been promising. Most recently, \\na placebo-controlled trial [the Study to Assess Safety and Impact of SelG1 with or without \\nHydroxyurea Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease Patients With Pain Crises (SUSTAIN)] of \\nhigh-dose crizanlizumab (5.0 mg/kg), administered intravenously 14 times over a period \\nof 52 weeks, found that patients treated with the active drug had a 45.3% lower rate of \\ncrises (P = 0.01) (12). Crizanlizumab had an additive effect in patients who were receiving \\nconcomitant hydroxyurea. Among patients receiving hydroxyurea, those given high-dose \\ncrizanlizumab had an annual crisis rate that was 32.1% lower than those given a placebo.\\nStem Cell Transplantation and Gene Therapy\\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become an increasingly acceptable \\ntreatment option for SCA. An analysis of 1,000 HLA-identical sibling donor transplantations \\nconducted between 1986 and 2013 has revealed excellent outcomes, with both children \\nand adults demonstrating 93% (95% confidence interval 91.1–94.6%) overall survival (82). \\nModifications to the intensity of conditioning have expanded allogeneic hematopoietic \\nstem cell transplantation as a treatment option for adult patients with preexisting organ \\ndysfunction, who would have been otherwise ineligible for transplantation using standard \\nmyeloablative conditioning (99). However, less than 14% of patients with SCA have HLA-\\nmatched siblings as potential donors. Alternative sources of half-matched (haplo-identical) \\nfamily donors have therefore been actively explored to make hematopoietic stem cell \\ntransplantation available to more patients (30).\\nGene therapy using genetically modified patient-derived (i.e., autologous) hematopoietic \\nstem cells would avoid the risk of graft-versus-host disease and could therefore be \\napplicable to many more patients (40, 84). Several gene therapy approaches are being \\nexplored. One approach is that of gene addition using lentiviral vectors (β-like globin \\nWilliams and Thein Page 16\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscriptstransgenes, short hairpin RNA for erythroid-specific expression, and lentiviral expression \\nof a ZF-LDB1 fusion protein). The most advanced of these is the antisickling β-globin \\nvector containing the HbAT87Q mutation (Bluebird Bio), which was first tested in a patient \\nwith transfusion-dependent HbE/β-thalassemia (41). The first case of SCA treated by this \\napproach reported therapeutic levels (>50%) of antisickling β-hemoglobin, no evidence \\nof insertional mutagenesis, an absence of crises, and the correction of disease hallmarks \\n(166). Interim results from a phase 1/2 study using this same vector revealed therapeutic \\nhemoglobin HbAT87Q expression in all seven patients with SCD. These data should reassure \\npatients regarding the short-term safety of gene therapy, although long-term safety remains \\nan open question.\\nThe other gene therapy approach is gene editing. SCA presents an ideal opportunity for \\ngene editing because of its SNP-based etiology, but the method involves nuclease-induced \\nhomology-directed repair, which is highly inefficient. Much more promising are approaches \\nthat cause the disruption by nonhomologous end joining of the erythroid-specific enhancer \\nin the γ-globin repressor (BCL11A); however, this method is error prone. The creation \\nof mutations in the HBB complex to simulate natural hereditary persistence of fetal \\nhemoglobin variants by gene editing is another approach under active investigation (193, \\n215).\\nCurrent Perspectives in Low-Income Settings\\nWhile many of the exciting developments that we have outlined above hold great promise \\nfor improving the lives of patients born with SCA in high-income countries, the current \\nreality is very different for the vast majority of patients who are born with SCA in \\nlow-income regions, where, until very recently, the condition has been almost completely \\nneglected as a health priority. No country within these regions has yet established a national \\nscreening program, and as a result, most patients come to medical attention only when they \\npresent with complications. As many as 90% therefore die, usually undiagnosed, during \\nthe first 5 years of life (87). As a consequence, in many parts of Africa, SCA is probably \\nresponsible for an astonishing 5–16% of total mortality under age 5 (127). Only a small \\nfraction of all research into SCA is conducted in the regions most affected, meaning that, to \\na great extent, the guidelines that are in place are not grounded in the local context.\\nThe last few years, however, have seen several welcome developments. The importance of \\nSCA has been formally recognized by multiple international organizations, including the \\nUnited Nations and the World Health Organization (197, 220). Moreover, bodies like the \\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the US National Institutes of Health are starting \\nto appreciate the importance of better funding through the establishment of specific funding \\ncalls (133). Further collaboration among governments, scientists, and international funding \\norganizations is badly needed if the plight of the majority of the world’s SCA population is \\nto be improved in the years ahead.\\nWilliams and Thein Page 17\\nAnnu Rev Genomics Hum Genet. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 September 03.\\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\\n Europe PMC Funders Author ManuscriptsConclusions\\nIn the century since SCA was first formally recognized in the scientific literature, it has been \\nat the forefront of numerous scientific discoveries. To a large extent, the translation of these \\ndiscoveries into new drugs and treatments has been much less impressive, partly because of \\nthe low number and marginalized status of those affected in resource-rich regions. In recent \\nyears, however, improvements in survival in conjunction with a growing appreciation of the \\ntrue burden of this condition more globally have led to a greater focus on the translation of \\nscientific knowledge into new therapies that could soon transform the outlook for affected \\npatients regardless of where they live. Perhaps most exciting are gene therapy approaches \\nthat now hold the promise of complete cure, although a great deal more will need to be \\nlearned about the balance of risk and benefit before such treatments can be rolled out to any \\nbut the most severely affected. In the meantime, a concerted effort to discover and develop \\nnew drugs aimed at preventing the complications of SCA is still justified, because such \\napproaches will probably come with fewer risks at a lower cost and will be accessible to a \\nbroader range of patients.\\nAcknowledgments\\nT.N.W. is funded by the Wellcome Trust through Senior Research Fellowship 202800.

Genetic and genomic developments are now translating to the development of \\nnew therapeutics that may radically reduce disease morbidity.\\n4.

Although it seems likely that curative therapies such as gene editing and stem \\ncell transplantation will gain traction in the years ahead, a range of issues, \\nincluding safety, cost, and timing, mean that new disease-modifying drugs \\nwill be needed for the foreseeable future.\\n2. SCA has evolved from a life-threatening disease of childhood into a chronic \\ndisease in adults, with many unmet needs.\\n3. Morbidity and mortality remain significant problems. The life expectancy of \\nsomeone with SCA still lags behind that of others without SCA by more than \\n20 years.\\n4. An inequity of treatment exists not only between high- and low-income \\ncountries, but also within well-resourced countries.\\n5. There is a need to develop a network of experts who could serve as resources \\nfor community-based providers.\\n6. Prediction of disease severity remains an issue; we need more, and better, \\nbiomarkers and genetic markers to allow us to focus the potentially toxic \\ntreatments (hydroxyurea, stem cell transplant, and gene therapy) on those \\npatients with high-risk disease.\\n7. It is now clear that all patients with SCA, however mild their symptoms \\nappear to be, are continuously undergoing some degree of chronic end-organ \\ndeterioration. It is therefore crucial that new drugs target the mechanisms that \\nlead to this end-organ damage.\\n8.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '2511.16868'}, page_content='The Joint Gromov Wasserstein Objective for Multiple Object\\nMatching\\nAryan Tajmir Riahi1, and Khanh Dao Duc 1,2,∗\\n1 Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada\\n2 Department of Mathematics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada\\nAbstract\\nThe Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric\\nspaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects,\\nlimiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object\\nmatching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the\\noriginal framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formu-\\nlation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of\\nmm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and\\nsolved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport,\\nincluding entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching in-\\ndicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments\\non both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including\\ngeometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex\\nmatching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.\\nIntroduction\\nFinding correspondence between two objects is a central problem in computer science with applications such\\nas shape interpolation and texture transfer in computer vision [1], account linking across social networks [2],\\nor protein structure analysis [3, 4]. Despite extensive research on object matching across these domains,\\nexisting methods mostly address full-to-full shape matching [1, 5, 6, 7], where both objects are assumed to be\\ncomplete with no significant missing parts. A smaller body of work focuses on partial-to-full matching [1, 8, 9,\\n10], where an incomplete object is matched against a complete reference. However, when multiple fragments\\nmust be assembled—a scenario arising in protein model building [4], merging partial 3D scans [11], and\\nsolving 2D and 3D puzzles [12, 13]— current approaches require sequential pairwise matching. This strategy\\ncan lead to error accumulation and increased computational cost, motivating the need for multiple-to-multiple\\npartial matching methods.\\nRecently, Optimal Transport theory (OT) [14] and its related tools became a popular choice establishing\\ncorrespondence between two objects represented as measurements over a metric space in graph matching\\n[15, 16], graph clustering [17], matching language models [18], and biomolecule matching [4, 3, 19]. In\\nparticular, approximations of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance [20] have gained popularity, as they\\nprovide a powerful tool for matching objects defined in different domains and are rigid body transformation\\ninvariant (so they don’t require pre-alignment). Furthermore, researchers have designed various extensions\\nand variants of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance [21, 22, 23] for partial-to-full matching. The Z-Gromov-\\nWasserstein distance [24] was recently introduced for the multiple-to-multiple partial matching problem,\\nassuming a Z-structure on the distributions. However, many multiple-to-multiple matching applications lack\\nsuch structure in the data.\\nIn this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) problem, that is a novel variant of the\\noriginal Gromov-Wasserstein formulation that enables the matching of two collections of objects simultane-\\nously. To summarize, our key contributions are as follows.\\n∗ corresponding author: kdd@math.ubc.ca\\n1\\narXiv:2511.16868v1  [cs.CV]  21 Nov 2025•We formulate the new JGW objective function, which extends the mathematical concepts underlying\\nthe Gromov-Wasserstein objective function, such as metric measure spaces and isomorphisms, to handle\\ncollections of objects. We prove theoretical properties of the JGW objective, analyzing its metric\\nproperties and convergence from point sampling.\\n•We investigate and adapt existing approximation techniques from the standard Gromov-Wasserstein\\nproblem to our the JGW framework, to produce feasible and applicable algorithms to compute it.\\n•We demonstrate the usefulness of the JGW formulation through benchmarks against other GW vari-\\nants, and experiments on object matching problems with various datasets including 2D/3D geometric\\nshapes and biomolecular complexes.\\nRelated Work\\nHere, we cover most recent works on partial and multiple-to-multiple object matching, with a focus on\\nOT-related approaches. We refer interested readers to [1] for a broader survey of object matching methods.\\nPartial Matching.Partial-to-full matching, where an incomplete query must be aligned to a complete\\ntemplate, has received considerable attention due to its practical importance in object recognition and re-\\ntrieval. Early approaches adapted full matching techniques by incorporating outlier handling mechanisms [1]\\nor by identifying and matching salient regions [25]. The SHREC benchmark for partial matching [9] has\\ndriven progress in this area, with top-performing methods leveraging learned descriptors [10], and region\\ngrowing strategies [25]. Graph matching has been extended to the partial setting through modifications that\\nallow node and edge deletions [26, 27], while point cloud methods have incorporated robust estimators [28]\\nand learned features [29] to handle missing data. In the optimal transport framework, partial variants such\\nas unbalanced [30, 23] and semi-relaxed [22, 21] optimal transport have been developed.\\nMultiple-to-Multiple Matching.Matching multiple objects simultaneously, rather than through se-\\nquential pairwise alignments, has been explored primarily in the context of full shape collections. Litany et\\nal. [13] used an extension of Partial Functional Maps to introduce a framework for multiple-to-multiple shape\\nmatching. Wu et al. introduced an alternative approach by simultaneous partial functional correspondence\\n[31]. In the context of Optimal Transport Theory, the Z-Gromov-Wasserstein distance [24] was recently\\nintroduced, extending the traditional Gromov-Wasserstein framework to match distributions equipped with\\nZ-structure. However, many multiple-to-multiple matching applications lack such structure in the data.\\nGromov-Wasserstein Distance\\nIn this section we briefly introduce the traditional Gromov-Wasserstein distance [20] along with key defini-\\ntions.\\nPreliminaries\\nSuppose we are given two compact metric spaces (X, d X),(Y, dY ) and measuresµ X, µY . Following [20],\\ndefine themetric measure space(mm-space) and theset of all couplings, two fundamental concepts for the\\ndefinition of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance, as follows.\\nDefinition 1.A metric measure space (mm-space) is a triple(X, d X, µX), where(X, d X)is a compact\\nmetric space andµ X is a Borel probability measure, i.e.,µ X(X) = 1and supp[µ X] =X. An example of a\\ndiscrete mm-space is illustrated in Figure 1a.\\nDefinition 2.Two mm-spaces(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY )are called isomorphic if there exists isometry\\nψ:X→Y, i.e.,d x(x, x′) =d y(ψ(x), ψ(x′))for anyx, x ′ ∈X, such that(ψ#µ X) =µ Y , where#denotes\\nthe pushforward operator. Note that isomorphism is an equivalence relation, and the GW problem aims to\\ndefine a metric between equivalence classes of mm-spaces.\\n2The main goal of the GW problem is to define a metric between “nonequal” classes of mm-spaces. To\\ncomplete this task, [20] definesisomorphismas a notion of equality between mm-spaces.\\nDefinition 3.Given two mm-spaces(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY ),M(µ X, µY )denotes the set of all trans-\\nportation plans, such that,µ∈ M(µ X, µY )is a Borel probability measure onX×Y, and satisfies the\\nmarginal constraintsµ(A×Y) =µ x(A)for any Borel subsetA⊂X, andµ(X×B) =µ y(B)for any Borel\\nsubsetB⊂Y.\\nFormulation\\nThese definitions enable us to define theGromov-Wasserstein distanceas a comparison method between\\nmm-spaces.\\nDefinition 4.[20] Given two mm-spaces(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY ), the Gromov-Wasserstein distance\\nbetweenXandYis defined as\\nGWΓ,p(X, Y) =\\ninf\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX×Y\\nZ\\nX×Y\\nΓ(x, y, x′, y′)µ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhereΓ :X×Y×X×Y→Ris called the loss function. With the typical choice ofΓ p(x, y, x′, y′) =\\n|dX(x, x′)−d Y (y, y′)|p we often denoteGW Γp,p(X, Y)byGW p(X, Y).\\nThe minimizer of this optimization problem is called thetransportation plan, and it can be used to find\\na matching betweenXandY, as a metric function between isomorphy classes of mm-spaces:\\nTheorem 5([20]).GW p defines a metric on the collection of all isomorphism classes of mm-spaces.\\nThe Joint Gromov-Wasserstein Objective\\nPreliminaries and Definition\\nTo enable multiple-to-multiple object matching, we extend fundamental concepts associated with the GW\\ndistance, by first introducingdistributions of metric measure spaces(see also Definition 1).\\nDefinition 6.A distribution of mm-spaces is a categorical distribution ofk X mm-spaces, usually denoted\\nX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX], where\\n(i)∀i∈[k X],(X i, dXi, µXi)is a metric measure space (called clusteri)\\n(ii)s Xi ∈R >0 is the probability assigned to clusteri.\\nFigure 1 shows an illustrative comparison between a mm-space (1a) and a distribution of mm-spaces (1b).\\nTo provide a framework for comparing distributions of mm-spaces, we introduce the notion ofembedding:\\nDefinition 7.Given a distribution of mm-spacesX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX], an embedding ofXis a\\nmm-space(X, dX, µX)such that there existk X isometries(ψ i :X i →X) i∈[kX], such that\\n(i) P\\nj∈[kX] sXj ×ψ j#µXj =µ X\\n(ii)∀(j, k)∈[k X]2,ψ j(Xj)∩ψ j(Xk) =∅\\n(iii)X= S\\ni∈[kX] ψXi(Xi).\\nWe call theψ i’s embedding functions.\\nUsing embeddings, we now formulate the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective:\\nDefinition 8.Given two distributions of mm-spacesXandYand embeddings(X, d X, µX)and(Y, d Y , µY )\\nwith embedding functions(ψ Xi)i∈[kX] and(ψ Yi)i∈[kY ] respectively, the joint Gormov-Wasserstein divergence\\nbetweenXandYis defined by\\nJ GWp(X,Y) =GW Γ∗p,p(X, Y),(2)\\n3where for all(i, j)∈[k X]×[k Y ]and(x, x ′, y, y′)∈Im(ψ Xi)2 ×Im(ψ Yj )2,\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) =|d X(x, x′)−d Y (y, y′)|p,(3)\\nandΓ ∗\\np = 0otherwise.\\nWe note that while the definition ofJ GWp(X,Y) uses given embeddingsX, Y, its value and the asso-\\nciated transport plan do not depend on these. They also neither depend on the choice of the embedding\\nfunctions:\\nTheorem 9.Given two distributions of mm-spacesXandYand different embeddingsX 1, X2 forXand\\nY1, Y2 forY, we have\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) =GW Γ∗p,p(X2, Y2).\\nWe provide a detailed proof of this theorem in Appendix A.\\nPartial Ismorphism\\nTo establish key properties of the Joint Gromov Wassertein objective function as a similarity measure between\\ndistributions of mm-spaces, we now extend the notion of isomorphism (Definition 2) topartial isomorphism\\nas follows.\\nDefinition 10.Two distributions of mm-spacesX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX] andY= (Y i, dYi, µYi, sYi)i∈[kY ]\\nare called partially isomorphic if there exists a distribution of mm-spacesZ, indexed by(i, j)∈[k X ×k Y ]\\nZ= (Z i,j, dZi,j , µZi,j , sZi,j )i∈[kX],j∈[kY ],\\nand isometry functionsψ X\\ni,j :Z i,j →X i andψ Y\\ni,j :Z i,j →Y j, such that\\nX\\nj\\nψX\\ni,j#µZi,j ×s Zi,j =µ Xi ×s Xi and\\nX\\ni\\nψY\\ni,j#µZi,j ×s Zi,j =µ Yj ×s Yj .\\nSimilar to [20] for mm-spaces, we can then extend Theorem 5 to distributions of mm-spaces:\\nTheorem 11.Given two distribution of mm-spacesX,Yandp∈[1,∞),J GW p(X,Y) = 0if and only if\\nXandYare partially isomorphic.\\nFor a detailed proof, see Appendix B.\\nRemark 11.1.Although Theorem 11 shows that some properties of isomorphism ofGW p naturally extend to\\nJ GWp, note that the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective function does not form a proper distance function\\nthat holds the triangle inequality (which is not issue for our goal of matching two collections of objects).\\nAs a counterexample, letX={0,1},Z={0,2}, both equipped with the uniform distribution andYbe a\\ndistribution of mm-spaces with two one-point set clusters of equal mass. One can verify thatXandYare\\npartially isomorphic, thus,J GWp(X,Y) = 0. With the same argument we can see thatJ GW p(Z,Y) = 0.\\nHowever,XandZare not partially isomorphic henceJ GW p(Z,X)>0.\\nPoint Sampling Convergence\\nIn the context of shape matching, having point sampling convergence for the objective is crucial, since objects\\nget discretized or represented by point clouds. The following theorem ensures that we also asymptotically\\nrecover JGW when doing so:\\nTheorem 12.LetX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX] be a distribution of mm-spaces andp∈[1,∞),n∈N.\\nConsiderni.i.d samples fromX(by randomly picking a clusterjfrom Cat(s i) and sampling a point inX j\\nfromµ Xj ), distributed into thek X mm-spaces ofXas{X n\\ni }i∈[kX].

ThenJ GWp(Xn,X)→0almost\\nsurely asn→ ∞.\\nFor a detailed proof, see Appendix C.\\n4The Joint Gromov-Wasserstein Objective in Finite Space\\nIn practice, we are interested in solving a discretized version of the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective\\nfunction. Formally, letX= (X i, dXi, µXi, sXi)i∈[kX] andY= (Y i, dYi, µYi, sYi)i=1∈[kY ], withX i andY i being\\nfinite for alli, and let us denoten Xi andn Yi the cardinal ofX i andY i respectively, soX i ={x i,j}j∈[nXi]\\nandY i ={y i.j}j=1∈nYi\\n, with pairwise distance matricesd Xi ∈R\\nnXi×nXi\\n≥0 andd Yi ∈R\\nnYi×nYi\\n≥0 . To simplify\\nour embedding notation, we also denoteX= SkX\\ni=1 Xi andY= SkY\\ni=1 Yi. We now createµ X andµ Y as\\ndistributions overXandYrespectively, as\\nµX[xi,j] =s XiµXi[xi,j], µ Y [yi,j] =s YiµYi[yi,j].\\nNote that with this definition we clearly haveµ X[X] =µ Y [Y] = 1.

For simplicity, we now assumep= 2 and\\ndenoteJ GW2(X,Y) byJ GW(X,Y).

One of the main limitations of the Gromov-\\nWasserstein distance is the non-convexity of its formulation which makes its computation challenging. To\\novercome this challenge, various approximations and algorithms for GW distance or its variants have been\\nproposed, such as linear lower bounds [20], entropic regularization [32], operator splitting-based relaxation\\n[16], and Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm [22]. To compute (4) we can adapt most of these techniques,\\nincluding methods used in [16, 32, 22], and one of the linear lower bounds proved in [20]. In the rest of this\\npaper, as a proof of concept, we focus on adapting entropic regularization [32], which is one of the most\\nwidely used approximations for OT problems [33]. To do so, we introduce the regularization term to (4):\\nJ GWϵ(X,Y) = min\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed X\\ni,j,k,l\\n|dX\\nij −d Y\\nkl|2IX\\nij IY\\nklµikµjl +ϵH(µ)\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n1/2\\n,\\nwhereHis the usual entropy function defined by\\nH(µ) =−\\nX\\ni,j\\nµi,j log(µi,j),\\nandϵ∈R ≥0 is called theregularization parameter.\\nProposition 13.GivenX,Yandϵ∈R ≥0, we have\\nJ GWϵ(X,Y) =min\\nµ∈M(µX,µY )\\n1\\n2 (⟨µ,Λ(µ)⟩+ϵH(µ)) 1/2 ,\\nwhere⟨., .⟩is the inner product of two given matrices, the superscript∧2denotes the elementwise square of\\na matrix, andΛis defined as\\nΛ(µ) =d X∧2µIY −2d XµdY +I XµdY∧2 .\\n5We prove Proposition 13 Appendix D.

None of the following\\nexperiments uses a GPU. All of the code for this paper is implemented in Python 3.10. and is available in\\nthis repository.\\nGeneral Evaluation on Partial Matching\\nTo evaluate the performance of the JGW objective, we first conducted a partial matching experiment by\\ncomparing JGW with other recent Gromov-Wasserstein variants involving two unbalanced measurements\\np, q(1 =|p|>|q|), includingthe mass-constrained Partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance(mPGW) [22],\\nthe Partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance(PGW) [21],and the Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein distance\\n(UGW) [23]. Although JGW originally operates on data from all clusters, we adapted it for this specific\\nscenario by employing dummy clusters through the constructionY={p}andX={X 1, X2}whereX 1 is\\nq/|q|with masss X1 =|q|andX 2 is a single point distribution with masss X2 = 1−|q|. Using the formulation\\nof (2), we notice that the formulation of mPGW [22] is equivalent to this special case of JGW. However, the\\ncomputation method suggested by its authors differs from the approximation we used for our computations.\\nWe generated the source distribution (q) by sampling 200 points from an Archimedean spiral with added\\nnoise, while the target distribution (p) combines 200 points sampled using the same method, but with 100\\nadditional points drawn from a standard normal distribution (see Figure 2a). We then applied mPGW[22],\\nPGW[21], UGW[23], and our proposed JGW method to compute the optimal coupling betweenpandq,\\nwith results visualized in Figure 2b. The results reveal a significant performance difference in structural\\npreservation. Both mPGW and PGW exhibit substantial difficulty in distinguishing spiral structure from\\n6added noise, incorrectly transporting nearly half (49%) of the total mass to noise points. UGW demonstrates\\nsome improvement over these methods but still suffers from significant misattribution, transporting 33% of\\nmass toward noise points, and failing to fully capture the spiral’s structural coherence. In contrast, JGW\\nachieves superior performance by effectively separating the true spiral structure from noise contamination,\\ntransporting only 0.9% of mass to noise points while preserving the geometric integrity of the spiral pattern.\\nAlthough we acknowledge that mPGW and PGW results depend critically on the initial coupling of their\\nalgorithms, our search across 50 randomly generated transportation plans, combined with the authors’\\ndefault initialization strategy, failed to yield satisfactory couplings, suggesting fundamental limitations in\\nthese methods’ ability to handle partial matching tasks.\\nSparcity of Transport Plans\\nAnother critical consideration in applications involving continuous data, such as shape-matching, is the\\nquality of the coupling matrix to find accurate one-to-one correspondences for geometric analysis. More\\nprecisely, this requires sparse transportation matrices. Note that in general, mPGW and PGW achieve\\ncompletely one-to-one matching matrices, so we here focus on both UGW and JGW, that produce diffuse\\ntransportation patterns due to their regularization terms. To examine this aspect, we analyzed the same\\nprevious experiment, and selected the leftmost point inqto visualize its corresponding transportation edges\\n(shown in purple in Figure 3a). JGW exhibits slightly more sparsity than UGW. To quantify this sparsity\\ndifference, we computed the variance of the transported mass from each source point inqfor both UGW\\nand JGW methods. The violin plot in Figure 3bdisplays the distribution of all variances, revealing JGW’s\\nbetter performance with an average variance of 29×10 −3 compared to UGW’s 38×10 −3, representing\\napproximately 24% improvement in coupling sparsity. We acknowledge that the sparsity of both methods\\ncould be enhanced by decreasing their respective regularization parameters, but such adjustments would\\ncome at the cost of increased computational complexity and runtime, creating a fundamental trade-off\\nbetween coupling sparsity and computational efficiency. Regarding computational efficiency, mPGW and\\nPGW complete their computations in 0.49 and 0.48 seconds respectively, leveraging their direct optimization\\napproach, while the regularized methods require substantially more time with UGW taking 227 seconds and\\nJGW achieving some speedup at 108 seconds with our current set of parameters, suggesting representing\\nJGW can achieve faster computation than UGW while delivering better coupling quality.\\nIn summary, our example (see Figure 2, 3) demonstrates that JGW discovers couplings that align most\\nclosely with structural expectations, outperforming all competing methods in preserving meaningful geo-\\nmetric correspondences. JGW achieves a superior sparsity/runtime trade-off compared to UGW. Although\\nmPGW and PGW offer computational advantages and perfect one-to-one couplings, these benefits come at\\nthe significant cost of the failure to preserve the underlying geometric structures.\\nApplications of JGW in Shape Matching\\nTo analyze the performance of JGW in applications related to shape matching, we designed experiments\\ninvolving 2D and 3D shape data. First, we used a typeset illustrating of three letters “A”, “B” and “C”\\n(see Figure 4asource) to build a distribution of mm-spaces with 3 clusters and use as the source space.\\nFor the target space, we used a different typeface and created one cluster with the illustration of the word\\n“ABC” (see Figure 4atarget). In Figure 4a, we color in the right panel ”result” each point in the target\\ndistribution based on the cluster from the source space, that has its corresponding coupled point in the\\nJGW transportation plan. JGW manages to transport 98.6% of the mass correctly, by using 450 points to\\nrepresent the data. This experiment took≈24 seconds to run.\\nTo test the performance of JGW on 3D data, we next used two 3D meshes from the CAPOD dataset\\n[35] of a human in different poses. We split the first mesh into 5 clusters, namely, upper body, left arm,\\nright arm, left leg, and right leg (see Figure 4b). We used the mesh vertices as our distribution points and\\napplied the same method to find correspondence and colorized matched points of each cluster in one color.\\nAs Figure 4bsuggests, JGW does a perfect job in distinguishing the arms and the body, although it confuses\\nsome parts of the legs. In total more than 80% of the mass is transported correctly, and it took 50 seconds\\nto perform this experiment. We acknowledge that due to symmetry in this particular example, it’s possible\\nto get the same result with the substitution of left and right arm/leg, depending on the initialization of our\\n7optimization process.\\nFinally, we evaluated our method on the SHREC’16 cuts dataset [9], which uses shapes from TOSCA [36]\\nand provides partial versions with different cuts (see Figure 4c). Since the SHREC’16 dataset provides only\\none partial cluster per shape, we computed the complement component as the second cluster to make it suit-\\nable for our method. Figure 4cshows the colorized correspondence diagram, demonstrating near-perfect\\nmass transportation. To quantitatively evaluate the mapping quality, we employed a standard measure com-\\nmonly used in shape matching [37, 31, 8], that is the geodesic distance between ground truth and computed\\ncorresponding points, normalized by the square root of the full shape’s area. Figure 4c(Correspondence\\nquality) presents a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of this measure across all mesh vertices. The\\nfact that the CDF reaches 100% at a geodesic error of 0.0001 suggests that this method can match complex\\nshapes with excellent accuracy. For this experiment we modeled the cat body with 10 4 points and it took\\n≈3000 seconds to run this experiment.\\nOverall, these experiments show the potential of JGW in shape matching problems.\\nAlignment of Biomolecular Complexes\\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, one of potential applications for our method is to align and fit biomolecules\\nfrom 3D density maps obtained from Cryogenic Electron Microscopy [3, 4]. To study how our framework\\ncan be applied in this context, we focus on the model-building application, where a density map (a large 3D\\nvoxelized array) and the atomic structure of its submodules are given, and the goal is to find an alignment\\nfrom the submodules to the whole map [4]. In the following experiment, we compare the performance of\\nour new joint alignment method with a previous method that uses UGW [23], named EMPOT [4] using\\nthe complex protein structure PDB:1I3Q [38]. While this atomic structure originally consists of 10 chains,\\nin order to keep the experiment simple, we here merged 5 small chains and delete 3 tiny ones, resulting in\\nan atomic model with three similar-sized chains (Figure 5aillustrates this simplified version showing each\\nchain with a unique color). To mitigate the impact of sampling point clouds from density maps, we directly\\nsampled a point cloud from each structure (each chain plus the whole structure), with 2471 points 1111, 862,\\nand 498 points from chains A, B, and C, respectively. Then we applyEMPOTand JGW to align these three\\npoint clouds to the whole map. Figure 5ashows the reconstructed model with each method, and Figure 5b\\nillustrates the result of alignment of each chain (in red) comparing to the ground truth position of it (in\\nblue). As the figure shows, JGW finds a near-perfect alignment for all chains, while EMPOT is off. For\\nquantitative measurements, we report correlation of the density maps, rotational error, and RMSD of PDB\\nmaps after applying the alignment for each chain in Table 1 that also confirms our visual assessment.\\nFinally, we also compared runtimes for the two methods. The runtime of JGW with 50 iterations is\\napproximately 805 seconds. For EMPOT, we performed two different alignments for each chain and find the\\nbest combination between these alignments, and the total runtime is around 5680 seconds. This suggests\\nthat JGW is more than 11×faster than EMPOT due to the fact that 1- we need to solve more alignment\\nproblems to align one-by-one compared to when we align them together using JGW. 2- The computation of\\nour approximation of JGW is slightly faster than the approximation UGW that is utilized for EMPOT.\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we formulate a novel variant of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance specifically designed to\\ncalculate a dissimilarity measure between two collections of mm-spaces, which we call theJoint Gromov-\\nWasserstein(JGW) objective. We prove several theoretical properties of this new variant and analyze\\nits behavior by showing useful results in the partial isomorphism and point sampling scenarios. Further-\\nmore, we propose a method to adapt existing algorithms designed for computing the entropic regularized\\nGromov-Wasserstein distance to approximate the solution of our formulation in practice. Finally, we conduct\\nextensive experiments testing our method on partial matching, shape matching, and cryo-EM density map\\nalignment tasks. Our experiments suggest that JGW is applicable to a wide range of problems, significantly\\noutperforming classical partial and unbalanced variants, including mPGW [22], PGW [21], and UGW [23]\\nwith particularly strong performance when matching multiple distributions. We also show that JGW is\\neffective for image matching and cryo-EM density map alignment, making it a suitable alignment method\\nfor cryo-EM model-building applications where multiple chains must be matched simultaneously.\\n8Among the potential directions for improving our method, we first mention that the choice of approx-\\nimation algorithm significantly affects the quality of the transportation map, which is crucial for applica-\\ntions involving continuous data types such as shape matching and cryo-EM density map alignment. Our\\nformulation of JGW can adapt most existing approximations and relaxations developed for the original\\nGromov-Wasserstein distance using a similar approach, including the methods introduced in [16, 22] and\\none of the three linear lower bounds in [20]. In the context of cryo-EM, while our results suggest that the\\npresent approach is suitable for model-building applications, further validation on additional structures with\\ndifferent approximation methods is needed. Finally, it would be valuable to test the method’s ability to\\nhandle highly heterogeneous alignments by partitioning the source map and aligning its constituent parts.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis research is supported by a NSERC Discovery Grant RGPIN-2020-05348.\\nReferences\\n[1] Sahillio˘ glu Y.

We call this map a projection.\\nProof.Defineπ X byπ X(xi) =ψ Xi(xi) for allx i ∈X i. By (ii) property of Definition 7, we know that the\\nimages ofψ Xis are distinct, thusπ X is injective. Also using (iii) property of Definition 7, we conclude that\\nπX is surjective as well.\\nProof of Theorem 9.AssumeX 1 andX 2 (respectivelyY 1 andY 2) are two distinct embeddings forX(Y) with\\nembedding functions (ψX1,i)i∈[kX], (ψX2,i)i∈[kX] ((ψY1,i)i∈[kY ], (ψY2,i)i∈[kY ]). Using Lemma 14, we define the\\nbijectionsπ X1 , πX2 , πY1 , πY2 . Now letπ ∗\\nX :X 1 →X 2 andπ ∗\\nY :Y 1 →Y 2 be defined by\\nπ∗\\nX =π X2 ◦π −1\\nX1 , π∗\\nY =π Y2 ◦π −1\\nY1 .\\nNow forx, x′ ∈X 1 andy, y′ ∈Y 1 by using the properties of projections in Lemma 14, we want to prove that\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) = Γ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′)).\\nTo do so, we distinguish the following cases:\\n•CASE 1:there existi∈[k X]andj∈[k Y ]such that(x, x ′, y, y′)∈Im(ψ X1,i)2 ×Im(ψ Y1,j )2.By (3),\\nwe can write\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) =|d X1 (x, x′)−d Y1 (y, y′)|p =|d Xi(π−1\\nX1 (x), π−1\\nX1 (x′))−d Yj (π−1\\nY1 (y), π−1\\nY1 (y′))|p\\n=|d Xi(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nX(x′))−d Yj (π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nY (y′))|p (7)\\nAlso it is straightforward to see that if (x, x′, y, y′)∈Im(ψ X1,i)2×Im(ψY1,j )2, then (π∗(x), π∗(x′), π∗(y), π∗(y′))∈\\nIm(ψX2,i)2 ×Im(ψ Y2,j )2. By combining this fact with (7) we conclude that\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) =|d Xi(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nX(x′))−d Yj (π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nY (y′))|p = Γ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′)).\\n•CASE 2:otherwise:Without loss of generality, we can assumex∈Im(ψ X1,i) andx ′ ∈Im(ψ X1,i′ )\\nwithi̸=i ′. Then\\nx∈Im(ψ X1,i)⇒π −1\\nX1 (x)∈X i ⇒π ∗(x) =π X2 ◦π −1\\nX1 (x)∈Im(ψ X2,i),\\nx′ ∈Im(ψ X1,i′ )⇒π −1\\nX1 (x′)∈X ′\\ni ⇒π ∗(x′) =π X2 ◦π −1\\nX1 (x′)∈Im(ψ X2,i′ ).\\nAs a result there exists noi∈[k X], such that (π ∗(x), π∗(x′))∈Im(ψ X2,i), therefore\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′) = 0 = Γ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′)).\\nWe finalize the proof by using (1) and get\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) = inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX1×Y1\\nZ\\nX1×Y1\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′)µ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n= inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX1×Y1\\nZ\\nX1×Y1\\nΓ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′))\\nµ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n.\\n12To simplify this equation, we perform the change of variablesx∗ =π ∗\\nX(x), y∗ =π ∗\\nY (y), x′∗ =π ∗\\nX(x′) andy ′∗ =\\nπ∗\\nY (y′) and we denoteµ ∗(., .) =µ(π∗−1\\nX (.), π∗−1\\nY (.)) the image ofµunder the product mapping (π ∗\\nX, π∗\\nY ).\\nTherefore, using [39, Theorem 3.6.1], we conclude that\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) = inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX1×Y1\\nZ\\nX1×Y1\\nΓ∗\\np(π∗\\nX(x), π∗\\nY (y), π∗\\nX(x′), π∗\\nY (y′))\\nµ(dx×dy)µ(dx ′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n= inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX2×Y2\\nZ\\nX2×Y2\\nΓ∗\\np(x∗, y∗, x′∗, y′∗)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n.\\nUsing the properties of embedding functions, it’s straightforward to check that\\nµ∗ ∈ M(µX2 , µY2 )⇐⇒µ∈ M(µ X1 , µY1 ).\\nThus, we can change the domain of infimum and complete the proof as follows.\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X1, Y1) = inf\\nµ∈M(µX1 ,µY1 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX2×Y2\\nZ\\nX2×Y2\\nΓ∗\\np(x∗, y∗, x′∗, y′∗)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n= inf\\nµ∗∈M(µX2 ,µY2 )\\n1\\n2\\n\\x12Z\\nX2×Y2\\nZ\\nX2×Y2\\nΓ∗\\np(x∗, y∗, x′∗, y′∗)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′)\\n\\x131/p\\n=GW Γ∗p,p(X2, Y2).\\nB Proof of Theorem 11\\nLemma 15.Given two distribution of mm-spacesXandYwith embbedingsXandYrespectively, there\\nexists a couplingµ ∗ ∈ M(µX, µY )such that\\nJ GWp(X,Y) = 1\\n2 (D(µ∗))1/p ,\\nwhere\\nD(µ∗) =\\nZ\\nX×Y\\nZ\\nX×Y\\nΓ∗\\np(x, y, x′, y′)µ∗(dx×dy)µ ∗(dx′ ×dy ′).(8)\\nProof.For this we need to show the sequential compactness ofM(µ X, µY ) and the continuity ofD. The\\nformer is provided in [40, p. 49] and the latter follows from [20, Lemma 10.3].\\nProof of Theorem 11.LetXandYbe embeddings forXandYwith embedding functionsψ X\\ni andψ Y\\nj\\nrespectively, andDbe defined similarly as in (8).\\nFor the “if” part, we want to show that ifXandYare partially isomorphic, then there exists a coupling\\nµ∗ ∈ M(µX, µY ) such thatD(µ ∗) = 0. By definition, there exist mm-spacesZ i,j with isometry functions\\nψX\\ni,j :Z i,j →X i, ψY\\ni,j :Z i,j →Y j satisfying the conditions specified in Definition 10. For simplicity, given\\nx∈X, y∈Y, we define\\nZ(x, y) ={µZi,j (z)| ∃i∈[k X], j∈[kY ], z∈Zi,j s.t.ψ X\\ni ◦ψ X\\ni,j(z) =x, ψY\\nj ◦ψ Y\\ni,j(z) =y}.\\nNow using this operator defineµ ∗(x, y) as\\nµ∗(x, y) =\\n(P\\np∈Z(x,y) pifZ(x, y)̸=∅\\n0 else .\\n13Now consider (x1, y1) and (x 2, y2) such thatµ ∗(xi, yi)̸= 0 fori= 1,2. Sinceµ ∗(x1, y1)̸= 0,Z(x 1, y1)̸=∅\\nand there existsz 1, i1, j1 such thatψ X\\ni1 ◦ψ X\\ni1,j1 (z1) =x 1, ψY\\nj1 ◦ψ Y\\ni1,j1 (z1) =y 1. By the same argument, we\\nsimilarly definez 2, i2, j2. Ifi 1 ̸=i 2 orj 1 ̸=j 2, since the images ofψ X\\ni s are disjoint (due to the properties\\nof embedding functions in Definition 7), then Γ ∗\\np(x1, y1, x2, y2) = 0. Ifi 1 =i 2, andj 1 =j 2, we have the\\nisometriesψ X\\ni1 , ψX\\ni1,j1 , ψY\\nj1 , ψY\\ni1,j1 , and we can write\\ndZi1,j1 (z1, z2) =d Xi1 (ψX\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψX\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d X(ψX\\ni1 ◦ψ X\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψX\\ni1 ◦ψ X\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d X(x1, x2),\\ndZi1,j1 (z1, z2) =d Yj1 (ψY\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψY\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d Y (ψY\\nj1 ◦ψ Y\\ni1,j1 (z1), ψY\\nj1 ◦ψ Y\\ni1,j1 (z2))\\n=d Y (y1, y2).\\nThis impliesd X(x1, x2) =d Y (y1, y2), so we showed that Γ ∗\\np(x1, y1, x2, y2) = 0 and as a resultµ ∗ satisfies\\nD(µ∗) = 0.\\nFor the other direction assumeJ GWp(X,Y) = 0. Using Lemma 15, there existsµ ∗ such thatD(µ ∗) = 0.\\nNow for eachi∈[k X] andj∈[k Y ] defineZ i,j as the set of couplings\\nZi,j ={(x, y)|x∈X i, y∈Yj, µ∗ \\x00\\nψX\\ni (x), ψY\\nj (y)\\n\\x01\\n̸= 0},\\nendowed with a measure where we assignµ∗ \\x00\\nψX\\ni (x), ψY\\nj (y)\\n\\x01\\nto (x, y) and normalize it. Now for (x1, y1),(x 2, y2)∈\\nZi,j, sinceD(µ ∗) = 0 andψ X\\ni , ψY\\nj are isometries, we haved Xi(x1, x2) =d Yj (y1, y2). ThusZ i,j can be\\nequipped with a metric function (eitherd Xi ord Yj ) and forms a mm-space, such that\\nZi,j →X i\\nψX\\ni,j : (x, y)7→x\\nand\\nZi,j →Y j\\nψY\\ni,j : (x, y)7→y\\nare isometries. Using the assumption thatD(µ ∗) = 0 and the isomorphism properties ofψ X\\ni andψ Y\\nj , we\\ncan further verify thatd Xi andd YJ satisfy the conditions for partial isomorphism, and thusZ i,j provides\\nthe desired partial isomorphism betweenX,Y.\\nC Proof of Theorem 12\\nProof of Theorem 12.LetXbe an embedding ofXwith embedding functionsψ i :X i →X, and{x j}j∈[n] be\\nnpoints in S\\ni∈[kX] Xn\\ni . LetX n ={ψ i(xj)|∀j∈[n], x j ∈X i}endowed with the uniform empirical measure\\non it. Asψ is hold the properties of embedding functions,X n is an embedding forX n. Therefore using (2)\\nwe have\\nJ GWp(X,X n) =GW Γ∗p,p(X, Xn).(9)\\nBy definition of Γ ∗, one can see that Γ ∗(x, y, x′, y′)≤Γ(x, y, x′, y′) for allx, y, x′, y′. Hence,\\nGWΓ∗p,p(X, Xn)≤ GWΓp,p(X, Xn).(10)\\nA similar statement forGW Γp,p ([20], Theorem 5.1e), shows thatGW Γp,p(X, Xn) almost surely converges to\\nzero asn→ ∞. The combination of this Theorem with (9), (10), shows thatJ GW p(X,X n) almost surely\\nconverges to zero asn→ ∞.\\n14D Proof of Proposition 13\\nProof of Proposition 13.Using the definition of entropic Joint Gromov-Wasserstein objective (J GWϵ(X,Y)),\\nwe can expand\\nX\\ni,j,k,l\\n|dX\\nij −d Y\\nkl|2IX\\nij IY\\nklµikµjl =\\nX\\ni,j,k,l\\ndX\\nij\\n2\\nIX\\nij IY\\nklµi,kµj,l −2\\nX\\ni,j,k,l\\ndX\\ni,jdY\\nk,lIX\\nij IY\\nklµikµjl\\n+\\nX\\ni,j,k,l\\ndY\\nk,l\\n2\\nIX\\nij IY\\nklµi,kµj,l\\n=\\nX\\ni,k\\nµik\\nX\\nj,l\\ndX\\nij\\n2\\nµjlIY\\nlk −2\\nX\\ni,k\\nµik\\nX\\nj,l\\ndX\\nij µjldY\\nlk\\n+\\nX\\ni,k\\nµik\\nX\\nj,l\\nIX\\nij µjldY\\nlk\\n2\\n(11)\\n=\\nX\\ni,k\\nµik[dX∧2µIY ]ik −2\\nX\\ni,k\\nµik[dXµdY ]ik\\n+\\nX\\ni,k\\nµik[IXµdY∧2 ]ik\\n=⟨µ, dX∧2µIY ⟩ −2⟨µ, dXµdY ⟩+⟨µ, IXµdY∧2 ⟩\\n=⟨µ, dX∧2µIY −2d XµdY +I XµdY∧2 ⟩,(12)\\nwhere⟨., .⟩denotes the inner product of two given matrices and the superscript∧2 denotes the elementwise\\nsquare of a matrix.

In the clinical practice, the \\nradiological effect of immunotherapeutic agents has \\nraised several more relevant and complex challenges for \\nthe determination of their imaging-based response at \\nsingle patient level. Accordingly, it has been suggested \\nthat the conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in \\nSolid Tumors assessment alone, based on dimensional \\nevaluation provided by computed tomography (CT), \\ntends to underestimate the benefit of ICPIs at least in \\na subset of patients, supporting the need of immune-\\nrelated response criteria. Different from CT, very few \\ndata are available for the evaluation of immunotherapy \\nby means of \\n18\\nF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron \\nemission tomography (FDG-PET). Moreover, since \\nthe antineoplastic activity of ICPIs is highly related \\nto the activation of T cells against cancer cells, FDG \\naccumulation might cause false-positive findings. Yet, \\ndiscrimination between benign and malignant processes \\nrepresents a huge challenge for FDG-PET in this clinical \\nsetting. Consequently, it might be of high interest to test \\nthe complex and variegated response to ICPIs by means \\nof PET and thus it is worthwhile to ask if a similar \\nintroduction of immune-related PET-based criteria could \\nbe proposed in the future. Finally, PET might offer a new \\ninsight into the biology and pathophysiology of ICPIs \\nthanks to a growing number of non-invasive immune-\\ndiagnostic approaches based on non-FDG tracers.\\nKey words:  Immune checkpoint inhibitors; Positron \\nemission tomography; Computed tomography; \\n18\\nF-fluoro-\\n2-deoxy-D-glucose; Non-\\n18\\nF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose \\ntracers\\n© The Author(s) 2017.

Cancer cells may \\ntake advantage of these checkpoints to escape detection \\nby the immune system. Some of these checkpoints such \\nas cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) \\nand programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have been \\nextensively studied as targets in the frame of the so-\\ncalled cancer immunotherapy\\n[1]\\n. CTLA-4 counteracts \\nthe activity of the T cell co-stimulatory receptor CD28 \\nand actively delivers inhibitory signals to the T cell\\n[2]\\n. \\nPD-1 has two ligands, PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and PDL2, \\nand its inhibitory effect is accomplished through a dual \\nmechanism of promoting apoptosis in antigen specific \\nT-cells in lymph nodes while simultaneously reducing \\napoptosis in regulatory T cells (suppressor T cells)\\n[3]\\n. In \\nthe last few years, the blockade of immune checkpoints \\nhas disclosed the potential of the antitumor immune \\nresponse in a fashion that is transforming human cancer \\ntherapeutics. CTLA4 antibodies such as ipilimumab \\nand tremelimumab have been tested in the last ten \\nyears in different types of cancer , starting with patients \\nwith advanced melanoma\\n[4]\\n. Ipilimumab was the first \\ntherapy to demonstrate a survival benefit for patients \\nwith metastatic melanoma. In a study by Hodi et al\\n[5]\\n, \\nipilimumab significantly improved overall survival in \\npatients with previously treated metastatic melanoma \\nand the drug was approved by the United States Food \\nand Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of \\nadvanced melanoma in 2011\\n[5]\\n. Similarly, nivolumab, \\na humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has \\ndemonstrated durable responses in several phase III \\ntrials and has received FDA approval in specific clinical \\nsettings in patients with melanoma, renal cell cancer , \\nHodgkin’s lymphoma, bladder cancer , and non-small \\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC)\\n[6-9]\\n. Figure 1 summarizes the \\nmechanisms of action of the two FDA approved immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICPIs).\\nEvaluation of response to ICPIs \\nHistorically, the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \\nTumors (RECIST) has been validated and used to eva-\\nluate antitumor responses to chemotherapeutic agents\\n[10]\\n \\n(T able 1 for a more detailed description). These criteria \\nare based on dimensional evaluation and rely on the \\nfact that the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents \\ntends to translate into measurable effects in terms of \\ntumor shrinkage from baseline. Furthermore, published \\nstudies indicated that achieving a response according to \\nRECIST criteria is predictive of remission and improved \\nsurvival in specific settings\\n[11]\\n. Conversely, both RECIST \\nand their revised 1.1 version assumed that an early \\nincrease in tumor growth and/or the appearance of \\nnew lesions correspond to progressive disease (PD), \\ntestifying drug failure and indicating the need of ongoing \\ntreatment cessation\\n[10]\\n.\\nSome exceptions for the use of these criteria have \\nbeen already suggested in patients treated with target \\ntherapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors as in this \\ngroup of patients the lack of tumor shrinkage in the \\npresence of a stable disease has been identified as a \\npotential surrogate end point for improved clinical out-\\ncome\\n[12]\\n. However , in the clinical practice, the radiolo-\\ngical effect of immunotherapeutic agents has raised \\nseveral more relevant and complex challenges for \\nthe determination of their imaging-based response at \\nsingle patient level\\n[13]\\n. In published studies, while some \\npatients have responded to ICPIs with the expected \\ntumor shrinkage (chemo-like response) or with a \\nstable disease (target therapy-like response), other \\ndistinct immune-related patterns of response have been \\nidentified. In particular , an initial increase in tumor size, \\ndevelopment of new lesions and then a delayed objective \\nresponse were also observed in patients treated with \\nimmunotherapeutic agents\\n[13]\\n. Specifically, in some \\npatients, the initial increase in total tumor burden was \\nproven to be due to inflammatory cell infiltrates by \\nmeans of biopsy. In these patients the initial pseudo-\\nprogression was followed by a decrease in tumor burden \\nor even disease regression. \\nAs RECIST criteria were not suitable to catch \\nthese atypical responses, the so-called immune-\\nrelated response criteria (irRC) have been proposed to \\nprovide more rigorous characterization of all patterns \\nof response observed in the phase II development \\nprogram for ipilimumab in melanoma\\n[13-15]\\n (Table 1). \\nThe main differences between RECIST 1.1 and irRC \\nrely on the fact that, according to irRC, appearance of \\nnew lesions (PD according to the RECIST criteria) will \\nonly result in progressive disease in case of a significant \\n(≥ 25%) increase in total tumor burden with respect \\nto baseline. Moreover, different from conventional \\ncriteria, if irRC-based PD is evident, it requires further \\nconfirmation after one month with the aim of capturing 29 February 28, 2017|Volume 9|Issue 2|WJR|www.wjgnet.com\\ndelayed response.\\nRecently, Hodi et al\\n[16]\\n evaluated atypical response \\npatterns and reported the overall survival data in \\ncorrelation with irRC and RECIST criteria in the context \\nof a retrospective analysis of 327 melanoma patients \\ntreated with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab. This \\nstudy indicated that the conventional RECIST assessment \\nalone tends to underestimate the benefit of PD-1 inhibi-\\ntor therapy in a subset of patients, supporting a need of \\nimmune-related response evaluation\\n[16]\\n. IrRC are thus \\nincreasingly proposed, but they have not been validated \\nyet in the context of clinical trials and most trials \\ninvolving ICPIs continue to use RECIST 1.1 to obtain \\nstandardized endpoints for regulatory approvals\\n[15]\\n. \\nHowever, although the irRC seem better than \\nRECIST , the former has some limitations. The irRC use \\nthe bidimensional measurements in line with WHO \\ncriteria that are now rarely used in clinical trials and \\nreplaced by the unidimensional measurement of the \\nlarger axis of target lesions (RECIST 1.0 and 1.1). The \\nbidimensional measurements introduce a greater vari-\\nability than unidimensional measurements and make it \\ndifficult to compare the responses with studies using the \\nRECIST criteria.\\nIs there a role for \\n18\\nF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron \\nemission tomography in the evaluation of ICPIs?\\nWhile optimal CT-based response criteria for ICPIs \\nare in the path of their identification, very few data \\nare available for the evaluation of immunotherapy by \\nmeans of \\n18\\nF-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emis-\\nsion tomography (\\n18\\nF-FDG-PET), one of the most used \\nimaging techniques in oncology. \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET is currently \\nthe most widely used molecular imaging modality in \\nthe clinical practice for staging and restaging of several \\ncancers. \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET is clinically indicated before and \\nafter treatment in patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma \\nand NSCLC and it is used in patients with melanoma for \\nFigure 1  Schematic representation of mechanism of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab, two Food and Drug Administration approved immune \\ncheckpoint inhibitors. To prevent autoimmunity, numerous checkpoint pathways regulate the activation of T cells at multiple steps (process known as peripheral \\ntolerance). Central in this process are the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints pathways. \\nCTLA-4 is potentially able to stop autoreactive T cells at the initial stage of naive T-cell activation, typically in lymph nodes, while PD-1 regulates previously activated \\nT cells at the later stages of an immune response in peripheral tissues. The binding between T-cell receptor (TCR), which is expressed on T cell surface, with major \\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) provides specificity to T-cell activation. However, T cell activation requires more than \\none stimulatory signal. Among them a central role is played by the binding between B7 molecules (APC) with CD28 (T-Cell). CTLA-4 is a CD28 homolog which does \\nnot produce a stimulatory signal but inhibits TCR-MHC binding and thus the T-Cell activation. Different from T-cells in which the amount of CTLA-4 is low, T-Regs \\nhighly express CTLA-4. In these cells CTLA-4 might play a role in their suppressive functions. PD-1 is a member of the B7/CD38 family of protein, which is able to \\nbind with two different ligands: Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2). PD-1 activation in a T-cell prevents the phosphorylation \\nof key TCR signaling intermediates and thus T-cell activation, resulting in suboptimal control of infections and cancers. Therefore, even though they act at different \\nphases of T-cell activation, the negative effect of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T-cell activity is similar. Moreover, different from CTLA-4, PD-1 expression is not specific in \\nT-cells, but can be observed also in B-cells and myeloid cells. The rationale for immune checkpoint inhibition (represented in red) for cancer treatment is that CTLA-4 \\nand PD1 pathways are strictly related to cancer survival and thus targeting these molecules or their ligands with monoclonal antibodies permits to impact on cancer \\ngrowth. Therefore, even if the exact mechanism of action of these monoclonal antibodies in the antitumor response remains unclear, research data suggest that it is at \\nleast partially related to an activation and proliferation of T-cells regardless of TCR specificity (due to the inhibition of the inhibitory activity of these checkpoints), which \\nenhances the anti-cancer immune reaction. \\nT Reg\\nAntigen\\npresenting cell\\nCancer cell\\nT cell\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nB7\\nMHC\\nCTLA-4\\nTCR\\nIPILMUMAB\\nNIVOLUMAB\\nCD28\\nCD28\\nCD28\\nCTLA-4 CTLA-4\\nPD-1\\nPD-1\\nPD-1\\nPD-L1\\nPD-L1\\nPD-L1\\nMHC\\nMHC\\nBauckneht M et al.

The use of \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET \\nin post-treatment settings is based on the assumption \\nthat tumor size changes are only the final step in a \\nsequence of complex metabolic and functional processes \\nduring and after treatment\\n[20]\\n. Two different types \\nof criteria have been proposed for the identification \\nof \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET-based response in solid tumors: The \\nEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of \\nCancer (EORTC) and the PET Response Criteria in Solid \\nTumors (PERCIST) criteria\\n[21,22]\\n (Table 1). Both criteria \\ntarget the most metabolically active part of patient’s \\ntumor burden, which is regarded as the most viable and \\naggressive disease site. In both cases, the so-called \\nstandardized uptake value (SUV) is measured at baseline \\nand after treatment. However , they differ for some rele-\\nvant aspects. The EORTC criteria were published in 1999 \\nand are based on the evaluation of a lesion-specific \\nregion of interest (ROI) chosen as the most \\n18\\nF-FDG-avid \\nat baseline and followed in the after-treatment scans\\n[22]\\n. \\nThe PERCIST criteria were proposed in 2009 by Wahl \\net al\\n[21]\\n and rely on the use of a 1 cm\\n3\\n ROI on the most \\n18\\nF-FDG-avid part of the single most metabolically active \\nlesion at each PET/CT scan (which is not necessarily \\nlocated in the same lesion in all scans). \\nRelatively few papers have compared the two \\nmethods in solid tumors and good agreement, similar \\nresponses and survival outcomes have been highlighted \\nin the available studies\\n[23]\\n. However, for the EORTC \\ncriteria, no recommendations on the number of target \\nlesions or on whether computing SUV max or average \\nSUV for response calculation are given while the \\nPERCIST criteria recommend the use of lean body mass \\nfor SUV normalization (SUL). In this framework, some \\nstudies have demonstrated a higher accuracy with \\nrespect to RECIST for both metabolic response based \\ncriteria in patients treated with target therapies such as \\nerlotinib. This finding is due to the relative lower tumor \\nshrinkage characterizing this type of treatment\\n[24]\\n. \\nSimilarly, an \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET-based five-point scale (5-PS), \\nthe so-called Deauville criteria, has been demonstrated \\nto be superior to CT-based response by scoring images \\nin the assessment of response at the middle and end of \\ntreatment in HD patients\\n[18]\\n. Again these findings testify \\nthat functional changes always precede morphological \\nchanges in the course of pathological processes. In \\nthis regard it might be of interest to test the complex \\nand variegated response to ICPIs by means of PET-\\nbased criteria. In fact, on one hand, functional imaging \\nmay capture different features of treatment with ICPIs \\nin terms of entity and time course of response.

Accordingly, given \\nthe well-known high metabolic activity characterizing \\ninflammatory cells, this feature may also hamper the \\nevaluation of \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET-based response to ICPIs. \\nSachpekidis et al\\n[20]\\n evaluated the role of \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET/CT after two cycles of ipilimumab in predicting the \\nfinal response to therapy in 22 patients with metastatic \\nmelanoma. They evaluated response to treatment by \\nmeans of the EORTC criteria and found that \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET/CT after two cycles of ipilimumab is predictive of \\nthe final treatment outcome in patients with progressive \\nmetabolic disease (PMD) and stable metabolic disease \\n(SMD)\\n[20]\\n. However , two patients were initially falsely \\nclassified as early SMD, but they later demonstrated \\nnew metastatic lesions, “upgrading” them to late PMD. \\nSimilarly, early evaluation by means of \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET \\ndid not identify responders to treatment as the two \\npatients eventually characterized with PMR were initially \\nclassified with early PMD due to new lesions\\n[20]\\n. In fact, \\nboth RECIST 1.1 and PET-based criteria consider the \\nidentification of new (metabolically active) lesions as \\nprogressive disease. Therefore, presently proposed \\nPET-based metabolic criteria suffer from at least one \\nof the same limitations that have resulted in the under-\\nestimation of response to treatment with ICPIs by \\nmeans of RECIST 1.1. Similarly, in the phase 2 study \\nby Younes et al\\n[9]\\n, nivolumab resulted in frequent res-\\nponses in patients with classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma \\nafter failure of ASCT and brentuximab vedotin. Most of \\nthese responses were maintained through the reported \\nfollow-up period with an acceptable safety profile. In \\nthis study \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET was performed at baseline and \\nat weeks 17 and 25. A negative \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET scan, \\nvisually assessed by an independent radiological review \\ncommittee (IRRC), was required for confirmation \\nof complete remission. The study demonstrated a \\ngeneral reduction of tumor burden. Yet, discordance \\nin complete remission between IRRC and investigator \\nassessments was largely based on the interpretation \\nof \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET scans and standardized uptake values \\nwere not collected as part of this study. The vast \\nmajority of other available data on the potential utility \\nof \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET after ICPIs are case reports more \\noften describing underlying challenges of monitoring \\nradiologic response in these patients and showing \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET features of inflammatory reactions. PET-\\nhighlighted autoimmune pancolitis, splenic sarcoidosis-\\nlike lesion and exacerbation of sarcoidosis as a potential \\nconfounder in the assessment of tumor response in \\na melanoma patient treated with ipilimumab have all \\nbeen described\\n[25-27]\\n. Similarly, Koo et al\\n[26]\\n illustrated a \\nseries of inflammatory reactions with avid FDG uptake \\nin patients treated with ipilimumab, including those with \\nthyroiditis, hypophysitis, granulomatous inflammation in \\nthe lymph nodes and skin, and enterocolitis. \\nAccordingly, the potential and challenges of \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET imaging in the evaluation of patients treated with \\nICPIs still need to be clarified and deeply addressed. \\nGiven the relatively greater experience of CT-based \\nevaluation in this setting and the fact that irRC CT-\\nbased criteria seem to better in capturing response to \\nICPIs, it is worthwhile to ask if a similar modification of \\nPET-based criteria could be proposed in the future.\\nPotential new PET-based approaches to evaluate the \\neffect of ICPIs\\nAs mentioned above, due to its intrinsic nature, \\n18\\nF-FDG-\\nPET displays not only cancer cell’s metabolic activity but \\nalso inflammation. Since the antineoplastic activity of \\nICPIs is highly related to the activation of T cells against \\ncancer cells, \\n18\\nF-FDG accumulation might cause false-\\npositive findings. Yet, discrimination between benign \\nand malignant processes represents a huge challenge \\nfor \\n18\\nF-FDG-PET in this clinical setting. Together with the \\nneed of the clinicians to discriminate between responders \\nand non-responders, allowing individual therapy \\noptimization and avoiding adverse effects brought \\nabout by ineffective therapy, several studies have been \\nrecently conducted to explore the possible role of non-\\nFDG radiotracers in the field of ICPIs. These studies, \\nmainly performed with labeled monoclonal antibodies, \\nopen the new era of the so-called “Immuno-PET”. \\nAccordingly, in 2014, Higashikawa et al\\n[28]\\n developed \\na molecular imaging probe that is able to evaluate \\nCTLA-4 expression prior to CTLA-4 targeting in cancer . \\nThis \\n64\\nCu labeled radiotracer is basically composed \\nof DOTA protein together with a CTLA-4 specific \\nantibody and is able to display CTLA-4 expression \\nin vivo. Similarly, specific experimental radiotracers \\nwere proposed for the visualization of PD-1 and PD-L1 \\ncellular expression\\n[29-32]\\n. Maute et al\\n[29]\\n measured PD-L1 \\nexpression by radiolabeling a PD-L1 high affinity protein \\n(HAC) with \\n64\\nCu and tested its feasibility in a living \\nmouse, while Hettich et al\\n[30]\\n developed two \\n64\\nCu labeled \\nimmunoPET tracers for imaging of both PD-1 and PD-L1. \\nAlso one SPECT study with radiolabeled anti-murine \\nPD-L1 in mice has been conducted\\n[32]\\n. More recently, a \\n89\\nZr labeled CD3 PET imaging agent was proposed by \\nLarimer et al\\n[33]\\n. CD3 is a part of the TCR complex that \\nserves as a global T lymphocyte marker . By serving as \\na marker of total T-cell infiltration, CD3 may represent \\na more direct approach than pre-treatment biopsy \\nor genetic screening to monitoring tumor immune \\nresponse, by directly examining active recruitment of \\nT cells responsible for cancer cell death. In this study \\nthe authors showed that CD3 PET imaging revealed \\ntwo distinct groups of mice, stratified by PET signal \\nintensity. While high-CD3 PET uptake was correlated \\nwith subsequent reduced tumor volume, low uptake was \\npredictive of suboptimal response. Altogether these non-\\ninvasive approaches allow simultaneous imaging of the \\nentire cancer mass and associated metastases, which \\nmay differ from the primary tumor in CTLA-4, PD-1 or \\nPD-L1 expression status. Immune imaging can be used \\nfor repeated assessment of the same tumor at different \\nBauckneht M et al.

Furthermore, although further investigations \\nare needed before their potential introduction in the \\nclinical setting, these non-invasive immune-diagnostic \\napproaches might yield novel insights into the biology \\nand pathophysiological importance of ICPIs as cancer \\ntherapeutics. \\nREFERENCES\\n1 Pardoll DM .
